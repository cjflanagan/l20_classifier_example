have been sparked by a pair of leather trousers Here s how it all unfolded It s just over a fortnight since Theresa May gave an at home interview to the Sunday Times telling the paper about her childhood and explaining how Brexit keeps her awake at night But it was her choice of trousers which cost a reported 995 that provoked most discussion I don t have leather trousers I don t think I ve ever spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told The Times adding that the trousers had been noticed and discussed in Tory circles She added My barometer is always How am I going to explain this in Loughborough market It was at this point that the story really took off with another Conservative backbench MP Nadine Dorries taking Mrs Morgan to task I think it shows Nicky Morgan s comments were sexist because she never criticised David Cameron s extremely expensive suits she told the Daily Mail Mrs Morgan then found herself disinvited to a meeting at Downing Street to discuss Brexit The Guardian reported Asked during a visit to Bahrain about the suggestion the price tag of the trousers made her out of touch the PM spoke of the importance of a country that works for everyone saying she had travelled around the country and met people in a whole variety of circumstances But the story inevitably by now dubbed trousergate was not going away and at the weekend the Mail on Sunday revealed a terse exchange of text messages involving Mrs Morgan and the PM s joint chief of staff Fiona Hill After Ms Hill texted ex Conservative minister Alistair Burt who had also been invited to the meeting at Downing Street to tell him don t bring that woman to No 10 again Mrs Morgan found out about the message the paper reported If you don t like something I have said or done please tell me directly No man brings me to any meeting she wrote to Ms Hill Your team invites me If you don t want my views in future meetings you need to tell them Ms Hill replied Well he just did So there While the Amanda Wakeley designed bitter chocolate clothing has made the headlines the spat plays into a wider row largely about Brexit Mrs Morgan who was sacked as education secretary by the PM when she took over in Number 10 has been vocal in calling on the government to set out details of its EU exit strategy despite its refusal to offer a running commentary She has warned about quitting the EU single market in a hard Brexit of the kind favoured by some in government and has said MPs should be given a say on the deal struck with Brussels Brexit aside leaked letters recently revealed a clash between Mrs Morgan and Mrs May over plans to deprioritise the children of illegal immigrants in school Mrs Morgan has also attacked government plans to expand grammar schools saying they risked undermining recent progress in schools None of this is likely to have endeared the Loughborough MP who considered her own leadership bid in the summer before throwing her weight behind Michael Gove to the PM Asked about her stance on Brexit she told the BBC s Sunday Politics I feel as though I m one of the people who s stuck my head above the parapet If you do that you re likely to attract attention you re likely to attract abuse but also levels of support She added I just think as a backbench member of Parliament you ve got to be there particularly when we have a very weak opposition to ask the questions that government needs to be scrutinised on before we embark on such a huge issue Does the row tell us anything about Theresa May s leadership style Some pundits think so Matthew Norman in the i thinks the PM made a mistake by disclosing her sense of irritation He writes To reveal such brittleness about something so minor hints at deeper and more dangerous insecurities In its leading article the Times says We get few glimpses of Team May s true tone of voice but this is one and its childishness is troubling Mrs May needs to develop a thicker skin Dominic Lawson writing in the Daily Mail also finds the episode highly revealing but he thinks it shows that Mrs May is her own woman in public as well as private describing a welcome return to unaffectedness Former chancellor Ken Clarke has not been impressed telling the Sunday Politics it was tedious that stories about what women politicians were wearing featured in the newspapers I feel sorry for women in politics he said I m glad to say men in politics don t have great news stories about what they are wearing In my case apart from my suede shoes I m probably very lucky because I m not a very snappy dresser Nicky and Theresa I hope will have some serious political discussions If they want to have an argument about what they are wearing I think all their closest friends would advise them to keep that private Another pro EU Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames said her comments about the PM s trousers were completely unacceptable saying they succeeded in trivialising a very important argument that a group of us was making about Brexit Tory MP Des Swayne told BBC Radio 4 s the Westminster Hour her remarks were impertinent adding I m afraid I come from a background where it was always rude to talk about money and certainly to talk about what people s clothes cost Perhaps wisely another former education secretary who was sacked from cabinet by Theresa May Michael Gove was cautious when Sky News asked him the most he had ever spent on a pair of trousers One of the things I ve learned over the last 72 hours is that politicians should not provide fashion commentary he replied", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Workers on zero hours contracts typically earn 1 000 a year less than permanent employees according to Resolution Foundation research People on the controversial contracts face a precarious pay penalty of 6 6 or 93p an hour the think tank has estimated For those who earn the least the size of the gap is even greater at 9 5 The foundation backed the government s decision announced last month to hold a review into modern working practices Understanding the reasons behind this pay penalty will be crucial in order to tackle some of the challenges raised by new forms of employment without jeopardising the success of the UK s flexible jobs market it said in a statement Laura Gardiner senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation added that the pay penalty of zero hours contracts was a big price to pay for work that too often lacks the security workers desire She said Zero hours contracts have hit the headlines in recent months for their widespread use in Sports Direct and JD Sports But concern about the use and abuse of zero hours contracts goes far wider than a few notorious firms There is mounting evidence that their use is associated with a holding down of wages As new ways of working continue to grow from zero hours contracts and agency work to the gig economy and wider self employment we need a better understanding of how they help or hinder people s earnings and career prospects Policymakers must also tread a

State John Kerry for calling the Netanyahu government the most right wing in Israel s history A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was not appropriate to attack the make up of a democratically elected government of an ally Mr Kerry has also warned Israeli policy makes a two state solution less likely Tory MP Crispin Blunt said he was unsure about the UK s intervention as Mr Kerry had been on the money Mr Blunt chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee said on its current path Israel could not stay democratic and Jewish The dispute follows a US decision not to veto a UN Security Council motion criticising Israel s policy of building settlements on land occupied since 1967 The UK voted for the resolution and Mrs May s spokesman agreed with Mr Kerry that the only way to a lasting peace in the Middle East is through a two state solution But he said the settlements were far from the only problem citing the ever present threat of terrorism that the Israeli people had had to live with The spokesman added We do not therefore believe that the way to negotiate peace is by focusing on only one issue in this case the construction of settlements when clearly the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is so deeply complex And we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally The US state department said it was surprised by the UK s response A spokesman said Mr Kerry s remarks were in line with the UK s own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations last week adding that the US stance had been welcomed by Germany France Canada Turkey as well as a number of Gulf nations President elect Donald Trump who will take office next month has been critical of the current administration s Middle East policy tweeting earlier this week that Israel had been treated with disdain by the US in recent years The UK is hoping to build a strong relationship with the new

were close allies in international affairs during the 1980s and developed a strong personal friendship But Mr Blunt defended Mr Kerry s efforts over the past four years at brokering a lasting peace in the long running Arab Israeli conflict and suggested Downing Street had been making a narrow point I have absolutely no idea what was behind Number 10 briefing in the way that they did he told BBC Radio 4 s World At One My only concern is it would seem to indicate that there might be something wrong with John Kerry s analysis in their view In my judgment there isn t it was an extremely fine speech On the substance and finding a long term solution that s in the interests of the people of Israel and peace for her Arab neighbours and a solution that beings justice for the Palestinians and security for the Israelis Kerry s analysis is very hard to gainsay A row broke out between the US administration and Israel after the vote at the UN Security Council last Friday as Mr Netanyahu accused Washington of complicity in drawing up the resolution In a speech on Wednesday Mr Kerry said Mr Netanyahu s public support for a two state solution including the creation of an independent state of Palestine did not reflect the views of the most extreme members of his government His current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements he said The result is that policies of this government which the prime minister himself just described as more committed to settlements than any in Israel s history are leading in the opposite direction from a two state solution They are leading towards one state Mr Netanyahu said the comments paid lip service to the unremitting Palestinian campaign of terrorism against Israel",

trade relationships both with the remaining 27 EU members and other countries around the world As a member of the EU the UK has been included in trade deals the EU has negotiated There are 22 trade agreements between the EU and individual countries and five multi lateral agreements covering multiple countries This means that if the UK wants to retain preferential access to the markets of the 52 countries covered by these agreements it would have to renegotiate trade deals with all of them Britain is a large market so there is a clear incentive for other countries to negotiate a deal

realistic Read more The UK s trade deal challenges Reality Check Who has access to the single market Reality Check Would UK have to make new trade deals Reality Check Could there be free trade without free movement Norway is a member of the European Economic Area EEA the single market along with the 28 current EU members Liechtenstein and Iceland In return for that access to the single market it pays a contribution to the EU budget and has to sign up to all the rules of the club including its common regulations and standards People from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway too but the country is exempt from EU rules on agriculture fisheries justice and home affairs The downside for Norway is that it has no say over how the rules of the single market are created Senior Leave campaigner and Tory leadership hopeful Boris Johnson wrote in the Telegraph on Sunday that the UK would continue to have access to the single market But would this be possible while also reducing immigration and cutting costs as many Leave campaigners want Ireland s Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said the UK is unlikely to secure full access to the single market unless it continues to allow free movement of labour And a senior German MP and ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel Michael Fuchs told the BBC that it would be possible for Britain to maintain access but at a price The per capita fee of Norway is exactly the same as what Britain is now paying into the EU he said So there won t be any savings How Norway s relationship with the EU has split views Switzerland has a free trade agreement with the EU and a number of agreements which give it access to the single market for most of its industries But it does not have full access to the single market for its banking sector and other parts of the services sector which together make up almost 80 of the UK economy Its agreement also requires the free movement of people The Swiss voted against joining the EEA in December 1992 Instead the country which sells over 50 of its exports to the EU has agreed more than 120 bilateral agreements with Brussels designed to secure Swiss access to Europe s markets Switzerland contributes billions of dollars to EU projects Its bilateral deals are now in danger of unravelling over the question of free movement of people after a referendum two years ago went in favour of restricting the number of workers arriving from the EU While no such restriction has yet been implemented Brussels retaliated swiftly stalling agreements and freezing participation in education projects Can Switzerland show UK route to Brexit Turkey is not part of the EEA or the European Free Trade Association but does like tiny Andorra and San Marino have a customs union with the EU This means it faces no tariffs taxes or duties on imports and exports or quotas on industrial goods it sends to EU countries The customs union does not apply to agricultural goods or services Turkey also has no say on the tariffs it has to impose on goods it imports from non EU countries as it has to apply the EU s common external tariff to those goods and is not involved in setting it Reality Check Would the UK face tariffs outside the EU Free trade area v single market what s the difference The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement Ceta between the EU and Canada is not yet in force although it has been in the making for seven years It gives Canada preferential access to the EU single market without all the obligations that Norway and Switzerland face eliminating most trade tariffs However some sensitive food items including eggs and chicken are not covered by it Canadian exporters will have to prove that their goods are entirely made in Canada which imposes extra costs to prevent imports entering the EU through a back door The services sector is only partially covered by Ceta Crucially a Ceta type deal would not give UK financial services the EU market access that they have now It would be hard for London based banks to get passporting rights for their services in the EU rights that they value hugely now It would also mean that firms that export to the EU would have to comply with EU product standards and technical requirements without having any say in setting them And critics of such a plan point out that the UK has a complex web of ties to the EU much more than Canada Reality Check Would Canada s deal with the EU be a good model for the UK Some advocates of Brexit have said the UK should adopt a unilateral free trade policy dropping all tariffs and relying on the World Trade Organisation s framework as reported by the Financial Times For example Hong Kong s free trade policy means the Chinese special administrative region maintains no barriers on trade The Hong Kong government says it does not charge tariff on importation or exportation of goods Import and export licensing is also kept to a minimum This approach may have some appeal to Brexiteers whose ideology favours no trade restrictions It would be likely to gather less support from disaffected Labour voters and left wing critics of the EU No tariffs of any kind could have a strongly negative effect on the UK s agriculture and manufacturing sectors as importing goods such as food and steel would in many cases be cheaper than producing them in the UK Reality Check Free trade free from regulation Viewpoint Brexit puts UK on new economic path If talks with the EU and others do not reach a deal before Brexit takes effect trade rules would default to World Trade Organisation WTO rules The UK and EU would be obliged to apply to each other the tariffs and other trade restrictions they apply to the rest of the world That is because the WTO rules allow countries to discriminate in favour of a trade partner only in a limited number of circumstances including a full bilateral trade deal", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest

quarter from 2011 to 2016 according to an investigation by the agency The government is committed to raising parks budgets between now and 2020 However funding in 2020 will be as much as a fifth below 2010 levels said the study even before inflation is taken into account Among the parks affected were the Peak District with annual funding cut from 8 3m to 6 3m and the Lake District from 6 9m to 5 2m The investigation found that once inflation was taken into account cuts over the five years were even more severe at 40 in real terms In 2015 the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Defra pledged to increase the direct grant for National Parks by 1 72 a year for most parks up to 2020 The figures exclude South Downs National Park which did not become fully operational until April 2011 The park saw funding fall from 11 4m in 2011 12 to 9 8m in the last financial year The Yorkshire Dales will see a bigger boost in its grant in the next two years as a result of the extension of the park area by almost a quarter in 2016 The Campaign for National Parks said that since 2010 the Norfolk Broads had closed three out of six information centres Dartmoor had reduced staff by 35 and

considering introducing a law to indefinitely ban the media from identifying young offenders Currently anonymity granted to under 18s by the youth or crown courts in England and Wales expires when they become adults The Ministry of Justice said it will discuss the proposals with interested parties If such a law had been in place when Robert Thompson and Jon Venables murdered two year old James Bulger the public would never have known their identities The recommendations are part of a review into the youth justice system in England and Wales by child behavioural expert Charlie Taylor to reduce reoffending The report states that 69 of children sentenced to custody go on to reoffend within a year Mr Taylor says the current system must evolve to respond to the challenges of today Under current legislation child suspects are granted automatic anonymity in the youth courts and are routinely granted the same if they appear at crown court aside from exceptional circumstances But once a child turns 18 their name can be reported The report says this risks undermining their rehabilitation as their identity could be established on the internet even though a conviction may have become spent for criminal records purposes Instead Mr Taylor recommends automatic anonymity should also be granted in the crown court and the reporting restrictions should last the lifetime of young defendants The Just for Kids Law charity welcomed the recommendation saying Being named and shamed for what they have done or accused of doing prevents them ever being able to move on Penelope Gibbs vice chair of the campaign group Standing Committee for Youth Justice said children must be given the maximum possible chance of rehabilitation There s good evidence that the kind of vilification that is associated with a child that has committed a very serious crime being identified destroys those chances of rehabilitation she added Mike Sullivan crime editor of the Sun newspaper said a new law would mean the judiciary would have the power taken away to decide whether naming a youth offender was in the public interest He told the BBC There are some children who have grown up disadvantaged or have committed extreme crimes and the point of the change would be to make sure the stigma doesn t carry on with them for a lifetime so it s not a life sentence I think most reasonable people can understand that The difficulty is if you have a teenage tearaway who is responsible for half the burglaries and is allowed to hide behind the shield of anonymity at what point are you not informing the public about the potential risks and therefore failing them The option would be taken away from the judiciary with these recommendations Conservative MP for Kettering Philip Hollobone told the Times the public has a right to know the identities of those convicted for serious offences Bob Satchwell executive director of the Society of Editors also hit out at the proposal telling the Times The idea of a blanket ban would be against any concept of open justice and the public s right to know and is a step too far Mark Hanna journalism lecturer at the University of Sheffield said while a new law goes against the principles of open justice the law has to balance the rights of juvenile defendants against the right of society to know who has been accused or convicted of a crime He added Arguably communities do have a right to know the identity of for example a juvenile who commits a very serious cruel crime at the age of 16 or 17 or who is a persistent offender so people can be wary of them as adults But the internet has changed everything because a report of a court case can now be read for an indefinite duration and so a person s offending as a juvenile could be discovered years later with a Google search of his name This could stop him getting a job for example even though he has become a law abiding adult Mr Hanna who is also co author McNae s Essential Law for Journalists said he would envisage that any new law would be worded to allow judges the flexibility to lift anonymity in the public interest The Ministry of Justice has said it would discuss these proposals with interested parties including the Home Office media and youth justice interest groups in order to better understand the case for change and consider the appropriate way forward Earlier

economic order which was likely to set the country on a path of permanently lower growth and living standards It also anticipated a demographic tipping point with a population boom and the number of people aged 65 and over predicted to rise by a third by the end of the next decade The report said this would impose new strains on the state with the funding gap for adult social care expected to hit

Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Barely an hour goes by at Westminster without someone parroting the phrases hard Brexit or soft Brexit They are fashionable political buzz phrases which try to describe what leaving the European Union might actually look like in big broadbrush terms But frankly they mean very little So let s take a look at one specific area where there are huge questions being asked about the future inventions When you chance upon your winning idea to become a squillionaire that garden tool that will revolutionise horticulture worldwide how do you stop it being nicked by someone down the road The answer a patent For the last 40 years there have been attempts to dream up an EU wide system for coordinating patents After this elephantine gestation period with the UK as a leading advocate of the idea a deal is now imminent It is extremely important for the British economy We are no longer a mass manufacturing economy We have specialist manufacturing But we are moving towards a position where we are a knowledge based economy where our innovation and our inventiveness something we are famous for down the centuries is to the fore again Gordon Harris the head of intellectual property at the law firm Gowling WLG told BBC Radio 5 live If we are to remain attractive for external investment then participating in this unitary patent system would be highly beneficial otherwise people have to have two bites of the cherry they have to get one patent to cover most of the European Union and another for the United Kingdom That could possibly influence investment decisions as to whether people prefer to invest their money here or on mainland Europe So what is the government doing Curiously it is pressing ahead with ratifying the agreement that is needed to get this new European wide system off the ground The UK s agreement is essential for the whole thing to get going because without a British signature under the current rules the whole thing is a dead duck In a written statement the Minister for Intellectual Property Baroness Neville Rolfe said The new system will provide an option for businesses that need to protect their inventions across Europe The UK has been working with partners in Europe to develop this option As the prime minister has said for as long as we are members of the EU the UK will continue to play a full and active role The government then thinks this is a good idea But it is also committed to Brexit What will happen in this specific instance when we do leave Put simply we do not know I asked the minister for an interview but she decided she had better things to do Former UKIP leader and now independent MEP Diane James suspects ministers want to quietly sign the UK up in the hope that after Brexit the country can remain part of the patent agreement One has to ask the question why even go down this route only to find yourself having to negotiate to come out Why have we joined up in the first place effectively giving over control to other European Union member states Would staying part of the deal be an option once the UK has left the European Union Some lawyers think the answer to that is yes But here is the crux If you have got a system where lots of countries are signed up to an agreement to protect inventions you have to have a system that can legally enforce it all Ultimately that is the European Court of Justice the EU institution that ensures the consistent application of and respect for European law For many Brexit campaigners that can t be allowed to happen It dilutes our sovereignty It also dilutes and takes away the legal control that the UK currently has We will find ourselves in a situation where other member states have a say in whether a patent is granted whether a patent is upheld and if they want to challenge that in any way it will go to the European court rather than our own legal system based in London Diane James said Hang on a minute intellectual property lawyer Gordon Harris responded Most countries cede some degree of sovereignty whether through Nato or the United Nations This would be a minor concession It is not a huge wedge being driven into our legal system It is a tiny corner but it would be good for British business so it is a concession worth making The government clearly likes the idea of the European patent system but in a statement said the decision to push ahead with it now should not be seen as pre empting the UK s objectives or position in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU And so in the meantime uncertainty This then is one of perhaps hundreds of examples of the kind of nitty gritty work that s going to go on in 2017 and beyond If 2016 was about the big picture in the EU or out the coming years will be about the specifics And lots of them", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Millions of people have voted in a historic referendum on

fund a trial of drone based deliveries of blood and other medical supplies in Tanzania The goal is to radically reduce the amount of time it takes to send stock to health clinics in the African nation by road or other means The scheme involves Zipline a Silicon Valley start up that began running a similar service in Rwanda in October Experts praised that initiative but cautioned that cargo drones are still of limited use to humanitarian bodies The Department for International Development Dfid has not said how much money will be invested in the Tanzanian effort or for how long It also announced plans to fund tests of drones in Nepal to map areas of the country prone to damage from extreme weather so help prepare for future crises This innovative modern approach ensures we are achieving the best results for the world s poorest people and delivering value for money for British taxpayers commented the International Development Secretary Priti Patel Zipline s drones called Zips are small fixed wing aircraft that are fired from a catapult and follow a pre programmed path using GPS location data The advantage of the design over multi rotor models is that the vehicles can better cope with windy conditions and stay airborne for longer In theory they can fly up to about 180 miles 290km before running out of power although Zipline tries to keep round trips to about half that distance Their drawback is that they require open space to land in Zip s case an area about the size of two car parking slots Zipline gets round this issue by having its drones descend to heights of about 5m 16 4ft when they reach their destinations and then release their loads via paper parachutes Afterwards they regain altitude and return to base before coming to rest The aircraft fly below 500ft 152m to avoid the airspace used by passenger planes Tanzania Rwanda and Malawi which uses a different type of drone for medical deliveries all take a permissive approach to unmanned aerial vehicle UAV regulations helping make them attractive places for such trials Earlier in the year Tanzania also authorised the use of drones in its Tarangire National Park as part of an effort to deter animal poachers Dfid estimates that flying blood and medical supplies by drone from out of Tanzania s capital Dodoma could save 58 000 47 400 a year compared to sending them by car or motorcycle But a spokeswoman suggested that the time savings were more crucial Flights are planned to start in early 2017 and when they do it is estimated that the UAVs could support over 50 000 births a year cutting down the time mothers and new borns would have to wait for life saving medicine to 19 minutes reduced from the 110 minutes traditional transport methods would take she explained The Ifakara Health Institute which specialises in treatments for malaria HIV tuberculosis as well as neonatal health issues will be the local partner The Humanitarian UAV Network and other non profit bodies recently surveyed the use of drones to carry out human welfare tasks The study highlighted the work Zipline was doing noting the firm was capable of setting up a new drones launch hub in as little as 24 hours meaning it was well suited to rapid response efforts as well as longer term projects But the study also noted that humanitarian cargos are often measured in tonnes rather than kilograms and need to be transported across longer distances than a Zip can manage Given these current trade offs relative to manned aviation the specific cases in which cargo drones can currently add value are particularly narrow in the context of the universe of needs that humanitarian organisations typically face it said And it added that more research was needed to properly evaluate whether existing schemes were as reliable as claimed Organisations considering the use of cargo drones need statistics on flights performed hours logged failure rates and other performance measures", "Share this with Email Facebook

team Mr Corbyn leader said in a statement I am delighted to confirm the appointments of four extremely talented women to our shadow cabinet These appointments mean for the first time ever two out of the three traditional great offices of state will be shadowed by women He added that his front bench would include 10 Labour MPs from the north of England and five black or ethnic minority MPs Ms Abbott said of her new role I am honoured to serve My first job when I left university was as a graduate trainee in the Home Office so my career has come full circle The position was vacated by Andy Burnham who quit to run in the Greater Manchester mayoral election By Iain Watson political correspondent Jeremy Corbyn s reshuffle sees big promotions for two women seen as his allies Diane Abbott and Shami Chakrabarti a year after he was criticised for not putting women in top shadow cabinet roles But the real significance is not who is in it is who is out The very popular chief whip Rosie Winterton has been sacked She was seen as someone behind the scenes who stood up for MPs interests against the party leader and who had been working hard to broker a compromise on shadow cabinet elections She believed that many more MPs might return to the frontbench if they were answerable to colleagues and not just to the leader So many Labour MPs tonight are expressing disappointment that she has gone And it is interesting that Clive Lewis the shadow defence secretary who unlike Jeremy Corbyn saw no pressing need to challenge Trident renewal has been shifted to become shadow business secretary One senior party figure has called the reshuffle cack handed and vindictive Unity has not yet broken out in the Labour Party Conservative MP Luke Hall said Ms Abbott s appointment showed Labour had lost touch with ordinary working class people He said By appointing a shadow home secretary who disagrees with the public and her own party about the need to control our own borders Labour have abandoned the centre ground Baroness Chakrabarti who was recently made a Labour peer joins the shadow cabinet for the first time Accepting the shadow cabinet role she said it was an enormous privilege and added I hope to follow in a great tradition of law officers on both sides of the aisle who have defended rights freedoms and the rule of law Mr Corbyn has also created a new position shadow minister for black and minority ethnic communities and appointed Dawn Butler to the role New opposition chief whip Nick Brown who served in the same role under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown said he hoped to bring experience and play a constructive role in providing the strongest possible opposition to the Conservative government Dame Rosie who was opposition chief whip since 2010 said it had been an honour to do the job and thanked the whips and the Parliamentary Labour Party for their support Mr Corbyn paid tribute to her six years exceptional service and said she had played an outstanding role in her support for me as leader and for the Labour Party as a whole But the Opposition Whips office are said to be deeply saddened by her departure BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said he understood Dame Rosie did not leave her job voluntarily and that there was some significance to her removal She had been trying to get a deal agreed on shadow cabinet elections and was seen as a bulwark against attempts to deselect MPs that disagreed with Mr Corbyn Several prominent Labour figures took to Twitter to thank Dame Rosie for her work including former leader Ed Miliband and former deputy leader Harriet Harman A number of MPs unhappy with Mr Corbyn s leadership have said they could not serve in his shadow cabinet including his former challenger Owen Smith Others are said to be considering serving under the leader if he reinstates elections to the shadow cabinet which were axed by former leader Ed Miliband in 2011 A spokesman for Mr Corbyn has told the BBC that there will be no shadow cabinet elections before November", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Learner drivers will be allowed on to motorways for the first time if new government plans are approved Transport minister Andrew Jones says the move would help make roads in Britain safer The lessons will not be mandatory and driving instructors will decide when their students are ready The Department for Transport is also looking at trialling a target number of hours of lessons to complete before learners take their test The proposal is one of a number of ideas being considered by ministers as part of a 2m research programme by the DfT into improving safety for new drivers The government said the change would allow learner drivers to get a broader driving experience practise at higher speeds and put their theoretical knowledge into practice Mr Jones said We have some of the safest roads in the world and we want to make them even safer These changes will equip learners with a wider range of experience and greater skill set which will improve safety levels on our roads For car drivers the changes would mean that competent learners would be able to have lessons on motorways with an approved driving instructor in a dual controlled vehicle For those on motorcycles the Compulsory Basic Training course which allows them to ride unaccompanied on roads would also be updated Motorcycle training would also require more online courses with novice riders having to take a theory test The plans have the backing of RAC director Steve Gooding The casualty statistics tell us that motorways are our safest roads but they can feel anything but safe to a newly qualified driver heading down the slip road for the first time to join a fast moving often heavy flow of traffic he said Many are so intimidated by the motorway environment that they choose instead to use statistically more dangerous roads so we welcome this move which will help new drivers get the training they need to use motorways safely New driver Cesca Astley who passed her test earlier this year told BBC Radio 5 live the first time she drove on the motorway was really daunting But Ms Astley does not think these new proposals would have helped I felt like passing my driving test was the confirmation I could do this I don t think I would have been confident driving on the motorway before I passed my test Tim Shallcross from road safety charity IAM RoadSmart argues that with a little tuition and supervision learners will find the confidence to use the roads properly He told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme They re our most inexperienced drivers therefore we should put them on the safest roads we have But Mr Shallcross said he didn t want to see cost obstacles put in the way of learners and that logged experience could be used over mandatory training hours The Times reported on Friday that the government was also considering plans to introduce a mandatory minimum learning period for learner drivers which could see them being made to spend up to 120 hours behind the wheel before taking their test A spokesman for the DfT said it was looking into a range of measures to improve safety for new drivers including a trial of targets for the number of hours spent learning but there were no current plans to introduce a minimum figure The department is also still asking for feedback from the public on the current training and testing for driving instructors Are you learning to drive Do you regularly drive

With commuters on Southern rail services facing yet another day of strikes and Crown Post Office workers pushing ahead with walkouts are we facing a Christmas of Discontent About 1 500 check in staff baggage handlers and cargo crew at a number of UK airports have also called a 48 hour strike from 23 December in a pay row In addition some cabin crew at British Airways have called walkouts while Argos delivery drivers this week suspended a strike at the eleventh hour The unrest is all the more unusual because for the last 30 years strikes have been falling to record low levels in the UK We ve not seen much strike action really since the mid 1980s says Dr Alf Crossman an industrial relations specialist at the University of Sussex Back then it was the great British disease It was like the weather something you put up with The number and size of walkouts has dropped sharply since the days of the Miners Strike in 1984 85 and the Winter of Discontent in the late 1970s In comparison last year the number of working days lost through strikes 170 000 was the second lowest on record The level of action now pales into insignificance compared to the Winter of Discontent in 1978 79 says Prof Gregor Gall from the University of Bradford Then a wave of crippling strikes spread across the country leading ultimately to the collapse of the Labour government and the election of Margaret Thatcher It s so difficult to draw real comparisons because so much has changed agrees Dr Crossman Before the Thatcher administration trade unions were more powerful while the railways British Airways and Royal Mail were all state owned We would not be talking about a Southern rail strike it would be a nationwide rail strike says Dr Crossman But there are also some parallels experts say such as stagnant wages for some workers inflation edging back up and the first fully Conservative government in almost 20 years It feels like there s an undercurrent of discontent building says Andy Cook chief executive of Marshall James which advises firms on industrial relations People are feeling the pinch he says Average workers feel they re not being paid in line with profits and therefore are more willing to stand up When Friday 16 December Monday 19 December to Tuesday 20 December Why Unions say the dispute is about safety but Southern and the government say it is political When Crown Post Office workers on Monday 19 December Tuesday 20 December and Saturday 24 December Delivery drivers to rural Post Offices on Thursday 22 December and Friday 23 December Why Jobs pensions and branch closures at Crown Post Offices the larger branches usually located on High Streets When Sunday 25 December to Monday 26 December Why Pay for about 4 000 staff who joined after 2010 on Mixed Fleet contracts When Friday 23 December to Saturday 24 December Why A longstanding pay dispute the Unite union says wages have not kept up with inflation Trade unions are at pains to point out that all of these strikes are separate The causes of recent strikes differ from strike to strike ranging from safety on the railways to closures of post offices Each dispute is specific to that workplace says Frances O Grady general secretary of the TUC trade union body Going on strike is always a last resort especially for the hardworking staff who take pride in their work and will lose pay while on strike she adds Of the four strikes only the British Airways one and the airport workers one are explicitly about pay Still the level of industrial unrest is on the rise The number of working days lost to strikes in the first 10 months of 2016 has already passed last year s total largely because of the junior doctors strike in April and the teachers strike in July The unions do seem to be flexing their muscles Dr Crossman says In the background there s also the Labour Party s closer relationship with trade unions under Jeremy Corbyn and the implications of Unite general secretary Len McCluskey standing for re election Companies are also less experienced at handling strikes says Dr Crossman In 30 years of relative industrial peace management have forgotten how to deal with industrial relations When it comes to Christmas walkouts unions have to weigh the risk of negative publicity against the stronger bargaining position particularly in sectors like travel and mail delivery where people rely on them more than usual With the Argos delivery drivers the threat of strikes helped secure a pay deal an example of the leverage trade unions can hold in the festive period Would it have got traction if it was in August Probably not says Mr Cook At least the possible disruption to mail deliveries and yet more delays for commuters on Southern is due to industrial tensions and not the weather The unrest during the Winter of Discontent was exacerbated by blizzards and deep snow And with weather forecasts this year looking milder that seems a more remote prospect for the Christmas of Discontent", "30 December 2016 Last updated at 12 44 GMT Bringing coerced silence into the counter extremism bill is a very dangerous business the government s terror legislation watchdog

cabinet papers show PM Margaret Thatcher who was told of the order said she was horrified that the intrusion had succeeded The papers are among records filed in 1989 and 1990 and released on Friday They also include a letter from Mrs Thatcher to Saddam Hussein asking for clemency for British nurse Daphne Parish who was accused of spying Details of how a magistrate from Hampshire persuaded Mrs Thatcher to change the law on so called acid house parties are also revealed in the annual Cabinet Office release by the National Archives in Kew Three anti nuclear demonstrators successfully cut through the perimeter fence at Faslane on the Clyde in the early hours of 10 October 1988 Mrs Thatcher was told of the incident later that day in an MoD memo that said there was absolutely no risk of a nuclear explosion or radiation But Mrs Thatcher writing by hand on the papers which were marked secret said I am utterly horrified Examples of slackness in sensitive matters keep coming to light The demonstrators went through an open submarine hatch to reach the control room of HMS Repulse a ballistic missile submarine where they wrote anti nuclear slogans before being arrested A fourth demonstrator attempted to swim into the base but was caught Mrs Thatcher added I must have an urgent report We could well have been put in grave danger The memo of the incident listed several failings including As a result of the intrusion Mrs Thatcher was told sentries were ordered as a last resort to shoot anyone suspected of trying to sabotage a submarine or nuclear weapon During the break in one sentry apparently saw the intruders but did not open fire Three senior Ministry of Defence police officers and 10 Royal Navy personnel were disciplined after the inquiry although more break ins would later occur one in 2002 and another in 2014 Since the Eighties anti nuclear protesters have peacefully camped outside Faslane which is now the home of Trident nuclear weapons Mrs Thatcher personally appealed to Saddam Hussein when a British nurse was jailed for spying in Iraq Daphne Parish was arrested alongside her friend Observer journalist Farzad Bazoft in February 1990 after the pair were found close to an Iraqi weapons research site The Prime Minister intervened for Mrs Parish writing to Hussein on 21 February The former Iraqi leader replied a week later personally assuring her that the law in effect will be strictly observed throughout the legal proceedings Mrs Parish was jailed for 15 years and released after six months but Farzad Bazoft was executed Mrs Thatcher wrote once more on 10 March to say that she was very taken aback indeed horrified by the punishments The Cabinet Office file containing the letters also showed that Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia was among those who appealed for clemency Cambridge University s debating society was full of rabid conservatives Princess Margaret wrote to Mrs Thatcher in 1980 The Queen s sister said there was not a Trotskyite to argue with at a rather dull debate about religion at the Cambridge Union Society In a series of letters which the cabinet waited a decade to file Princess Margaret also dismissed Muhammad Ali as a silly boxer At the time Ali had been visiting African countries to convince them to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics The princess thought he would make a hash of it A Thatcherite crackdown on acid house raves came from an unlikely source a village magistrate In August 1989 Gerald Coke a justice of the peace from Bentley in Hampshire complained to his local MP that an all night rave had kept the entire village awake Despite 3 000 people apparently attending the party police had refused to intervene I have never known such a feeling of collective anger and helplessness he wrote warning there was a real risk of bloodshed or serious damage to property if people decided to take matters into their own hands Crucially the letter reached Downing Street because Mr Coke also copied in his nephew Archie Hamilton the Prime Minister s former parliamentary private secretary Mrs Thatcher told her officials to take action If this is a new fashion we must be prepared for it and preferably prevent such things from starting she wrote Two months later the government outlined plans for a private member s bill to introduce fines of up to 20 000 for illegal party organisers and new powers to confiscate their profits Other archive files released reveal", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Jeremy Corbyn s election in September 2015 as Labour leader at the age of 66 counted as one of the biggest upsets in British political history His re election to the post almost a year later was not such a surprise but could prove even more momentous in terms of Labour s direction in the coming years and the future course of British politics Seeing off the challenge of Owen Smith who had the backing of the majority of Labour MPs has made Mr Corbyn for the time being at least seemingly unassailable and increased the likelihood that he will lead the opposition into the next general election scheduled for 2020 If that is the case Mr Corbyn will be a highly influential figure during one of the most important political periods of the past 50 years as the clock ticks down to the UK s exit from the EU following the Brexit referendum vote To his critics he is almost a caricature of the archetypal bearded leftie an unelectable throwback to the dark days of the 1980s when Labour valued ideological purity more than winning power But to his army of supporters he is the only honest man left in politics someone who can inspire a new generation of activists and make them believe that there is an alternative to the neo liberal Thatcherite consensus that has let them down so badly A fixture on the British left for more than 40 years he has been an almost ever present figure at demos and marches a joiner of committees a champion of controversial causes a tireless pamphleteer handy with a megaphone But not even his most ardent admirers would have had him down as a future leader of Her Majesty s opposition And not just because he believes in the abolition of the Monarchy Corbyn s brand of left wing politics was meant to have been consigned to the dustbin of history by New Labour He belongs to what had been a dwindling band of MPs which also includes Diane Abbott and John McDonnell who held fast to their socialist principles as their party marched moved right and into power under Tony Blair At the start of the 2015 leadership contest after scraping on to the ballot paper at the last minute thanks to charity nominations from Labour MPs who wanted a token left wing candidate to broaden the debate he explained to The Guardian why he had decided to run Well Diane and John have done it before so it was my turn Asked if he had taken some persuading he replied Yeah I have never held any appointed office so in that sense it s unusual but if I can promote some causes and debate by doing this then good That s why I m doing it He added At my age I m not likely to be a long term contender am I That view was quickly revised as Corbynmania took hold Something about the Islington North MP struck a chord with Labour leadership voters in a way that his three younger more polished more careerist rivals patently did not Despite or perhaps because of his unassuming low key style he seemed able to inspire people who had lost faith in Labour during the Blair Brown years and bring hope to young activists fired up by his anti austerity message His entry into the contest also prompted a surge in people many from the left of the existing Labour membership joining the party or paying 3 to become registered supporters His perceived integrity and lifelong commitment to the socialist cause made him an attractive option to many left wing voters jaded by the spin and soundbites of the Westminster political classes Over the course of a year or so since becoming leader he has become something of a cult figure ironic for someone who always insisted he didn t do personality politics and had never tried to cultivate a following among MPs Instead of amusing anecdotes about youthful indiscretions or tales of climbing Westminster s greasy pole his political biography is dominated by the list of the causes he has championed and committees he has served on He once confessed he had never smoked cannabis practically unheard of in the left wing circles he grew up in but the mark of a man who is known for his austere almost ascetic approach to life His frugality is legendary He usually has the lowest expenses claims of any MP Well I don t spend a lot of money I lead a very normal life I ride a bicycle and I don t have a car he told The Guardian Asked what his favourite biscuit was during a Mumsnet Q A he answered I m totally anti sugar on health grounds so eat very few biscuits but if forced to accept one it s always a pleasure to have a shortbread Jeremy Bernard Corbyn had an impeccable middle class upbringing He spent his early years in the picturesque Wiltshire village of Kington St Michael When he was seven the family moved to a seven bedroomed manor house in the hamlet of Pave Lane in Shropshire The youngest of four boys he enjoyed an idyllic childhood in what he himself has called a rural Tory shire Personal life Lives with third wife Has three sons from earlier marriage Food and drink A vegetarian who rarely drinks alcohol According to The Guardian his favourite restaurant is Gaby s diner in London s West End where he likes to eat hummus after taking part in demonstrations in Trafalgar Square Hobbies Running cycling cricket and Arsenal football club According to the Financial Times He loves making jam with fruit grown on his allotment belongs to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cheese and is a borderline trainspotter He does not own a car He is known for having an unusual hobby an interest in the history and design of manhole covers Culture A lover of the works of Irish poet WB Yeats His favourite novelist is said to be the late Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe whose most famous work Things Fall Apart is about the tensions between colonialism and traditional societies He is a fluent Spanish speaker and enjoys Latin American literature His favourite films are said to be The Great Gatsby and Casablanca His brother Piers now a meteorologist known for denying climate change is a product of human activity has described the Corbyn boys as country bumpkins Corbyn disagrees with his brother on climate change but they remain close They both learned their politics at the family dinner table where left wing causes and social justice were a frequent topic of debate Their maths teacher mother Naomi and electrical engineer father David were peace campaigners who met at a London rally for supporters of Spain s Republicans in the fight against Franco s fascists Piers who would go on to be a well known squatters leader in 1960s London was even further to the left than Jeremy Both boys joined the local Wrekin Labour Party and the Young Socialists while still at school Corbyn had begun his education at the fee paying preparatory school Castle House in Newport before moving into the state sector after passing his 11 plus He was one of only two Labour supporting boys at Adams Grammar School in Newport when his class held a mock election in 1964 In an interview with The Sun his friend Bob Mallett recalls Corbyn being jeered by his right wing schoolmates Jeremy was the Labour candidate and I his campaign manager because at a middle class boarding grammar school in leafy Shropshire there weren t many socialists We were trounced Corbyn left Adams with two A levels both at grade E and an enduring hatred of selective education It was an illegal war and therefore Tony Blair has to explain to that

winning the Beard Liberation Front s Beard of the Year award in 2002 He reportedly split up with his second wife Claudia after she insisted on sending their son Ben now a football coach with Premier League Watford to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Barnet instead of an Islington comprehensive After leaving school Corbyn spent two years in Jamaica with Voluntary Service Overseas something he has described as an amazing experience Back in the UK he threw himself into trade union activism initially with now long defunct National Union of Tailors and Garment Makers He started a course in Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic but left after a series of arguments with his tutors over the curriculum He probably knew more than them Piers told The Sun A successful career as a trade union organiser followed with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union AEEU and then the National Union of Public Employees NUPE But his real passion was for Labour Party politics and in 1974 he was elected to Haringey District Council in North London In the same year he married fellow Labour councillor Jane Chapman a university lecturer Chapman says she married Corbyn for his honesty and principles but she soon grew weary of his intense focus on politics Politics became our life He was out most evenings because when we weren t at meetings he would go to the Labour headquarters and do photocopying in those days you couldn t print because there were no computers she told The Mail on Sunday Jeremy is a saintly figure of enormous personal integrity He is a man who lives his life according to his beliefs former Labour MP Chris Mullin speaking to Panorama If Jeremy Corbyn becomes leader it won t be a defeat like 1983 or 2015 at the next election It will mean rout possibly annihilation former Labour leader and prime minister Tony Blair The showbiz glitz of New Labour temporarily hid the hole where the heart of Labour was supposed to be Now the Corbynites whoever expected to use that phrase are trying to hide that hole behind some old banners and a bloke with a beard left wing commentator Mick Hume There is something inherently virtuous about him and that is a quality that can rally the support of a lot of people and most importantly a lot of young people singer and activist Charlotte Church pictured While most of his chums have all moderated their views dumped their corduroy jackets and grey suits shaved their beards and quietly cancelled their CND subscriptions he has hardly changed a bit he is the Fidel Castro of London N1 Telegraph journalist Robert Hardman They shared a love of animals they had a tabby cat called Harold Wilson and enjoyed camping holidays together in Europe on Corbyn s motorbike But fun was in short supply at home recalls Chapman who remains in touch with Corbyn and backed his leadership bid During their five years together he never once took her dinner she told The Mail preferring instead to grab a can of beans and eat it straight from the can to save time In 1987 Corbyn married Claudia Bracchita a Chilean exile with whom he had three sons The youngest Tommy was born while Corbyn was lecturing NUPE members elsewhere in the same hospital Twenty five year old Seb has been helping out on his father s leadership campaign The couple separated in 1999 but remained on good terms Corbyn got married for a third time last year to his long term partner Laura Alvarez a 46 year old Mexican fair trade coffee importer In the bitter internal warfare that split Labour in the late 1970s and early eighties Corbyn was firmly on the side of the quasi Marxist hard left A Labour man to his fingertips he was no Militant entryist trying to infiltrate the party by stealth he nevertheless found common cause with former Trotskyists such as Ted Knight and joined them in their battle to push the party to the left He became a disciple of Tony Benn sharing his mentor s brand of democractic socialism with its belief in worker controlled industries and state planning of the economy as well as Benn s commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament and a united Ireland Here is just a small selection of the campaigns Jeremy Corbyn has been involved with over the past 50 years Nuclear disarmament Joined CND as a schoolboy in 1966 Irish Republicanism Organised Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams visit to the Commons in 1983 Once employed Irish Republican dissident Ronan Bennett as a member of staff at Westminster Miners strike Invited striking miners into Commons gallery in 1985 who were expelled for shouting Coal not Dole Anti Apartheid serving on the National Executive of the Anti Apartheid Movement and was arrested in 1984 for protesting outside South Africa House Palestinian solidarity A member of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and campaigns regularly against the conflict in Gaza Miscarriages of justice Worked on on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six who were eventually found to be have been wrongly convicted of IRA bombings in England in the mid 1970s Animal rights Joined the League Against Cruel Sports at school became a vegetarian at 20 after working on a pig farm Iraq war Chaired the Stop the War coalition Gay rights Spoke out in 1983 on a No socialism without gay liberation platform and continued to campaign for Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender rights Corbyn was never seen as a great orator like Benn or a firebrand like miners leader Arthur Scargill but he worked tirelessly behind the scenes his trousers stained with purple ink from the copying machines that produced the pamphlets and newspapers that were the lifeblood of the British Left in the pre internet era He ran the London Labour Briefing newspaper which helped propel Ken Livingstone to power on the Greater London Council He was elected to Parliament in 1983 to represent his home patch of Islington North a seat he has held ever since and where he has increased his majority from 5 600 to 21 000 and as a back benchers was by most accounts a popular and hard working MP The Bennite faction that Corbyn belonged to was already in retreat following their leader s failure to capture the deputy leadership of the party in 1981 After fighting and losing the 1983 election on arguably the most left wing manifesto it had ever put before the British public with its commitment to renationalising the utilities just privatised by the Thatcher government pulling out of the EU nuclear disarmament and the creation of a national investment bank to create jobs Labour began the painful process of modernisation that led to the birth of New Labour And Corbyn would spend the next 32 years on the backbenches fighting a rearguard action against his party s abandonment of the radical policies and values contained in the 83 manifesto in the name of electability under Neil Kinnock John Smith and most notably Tony Blair Corbyn might have hailed from the same North London district as Blair and entered Parliament in the same year but that is where the similarity ended He abhorred Blair s embrace of free market economics and did his best to be a thorn in the younger man s side throughout his time in Downing Street although Blair s large majorities ensured the damage was barely noticeable He would always vote with his conscience rather than be dictated to by the party whips It earned him the accolade of being Labour s most rebellious MP defying the party managers more than 500 times It also meant he and his allies became increasingly isolated with their views and interventions ignored by the mainstream media and most of their colleagues on the Labour benches Blair s dire warnings that Labour would face annihilation if it elected Corbyn during the leadership contest were met by Corbyn with a suggestion that his predecessor as Labour leader should probably face trial for war crimes over his role in the Iraq war Corbyn and his comrades unlike their modernising colleagues they would use the term without irony routinely attached themselves to any cause that felt like it would strike a blow against British and American imperialism or the Israeli state Internationalist in outlook they would proclaim solidarity with socialist campaigns and governments in places like Cuba Chile Nicaragua El Salvador and attack US policies that in Corbyn s view enslaved the Latin American world He incurred the wrath of the Labour leadership early on his career when he invited two former IRA prisoners to speak at Westminster two weeks after the Brighton bomb that had nearly killed Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet Later on it would be his willingness to share platforms with representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah that would put him at the centre of controversy When challenged he insists he does not share their views but that peace will never be achieved without talking to all sides He may have been largely sidelined in the House of Commons respected but too much of a known quantity to have an impact but Corbyn s stature and profile outside Parliament continued to grow He chaired the Stop the War Coalition and became a leading figure in the anti austerity movement which began to attract large crowds of young activists eager for something to believe in and to take the fight to then Prime Minister David Cameron Still no one gave Corbyn a prayer when he entered the contest to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader with bookmakers offering a price of 200 1 His elevation to rock star status among the crowds who flocked to his leadership campaign meetings must have been as much of a shock to Corbyn as it was to his opponents but he never showed it He carried on just as he always had railing against inequality talking about hope promising to renationalise industries tax the rich and scrap Trident and wearing the same white open necked shirt with pens sticking out of the top pocket Only now people were listening During that leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn is understood to have rejected pleas from some supporters for him to stand aside having made his point and injected new life into Labour s left to leave the field clear for a younger candidate who might have more electoral appeal He appeared determined to make a go of the leadership Many moderate shadow cabinet members returned to the backbenches rather than serve under him but he was able to put together a top team that reflected a broad range of opinion within the party He sought to bring a new approach to leadership adopting a less confrontational and more conversational tone at Prime Minister s Questions and generally refraining from either sound bites or photo opportunities to the exasperation of what his supporters call the mainstream media and the derision of some commentators The coalition behind Mr Corbyn held together for nine months despite growing discontent among Labour MPs who had never wanted him as leader and could not accept either his style of leadership or his policies The EU referendum brought things to a head Corbyn who had been a Eurosceptic as a backbencher was accused of mounting a half hearted campaign to keep Britain in the EU and of not appearing to care too much that his side had lost Labour MPs some of whom had been plotting to topple Corbyn at some point saw this as the chance to make their move to try and force him to stand down amid fears they would be wiped out at a snap election they expected to follow the referendum with him as leader He faced a mass walkout from the shadow cabinet and then a vote of no confidence which he lost by 172 votes to 40 as Labour MPs enemies and previously loyal shadow ministers alike urged him to quit He refused to budge pointing to the huge mandate he had received from Labour members and arguing that he had done better than many had expected in the electoral tests he had faced since becoming leader MPs selected Owen Smith a former member of his shadow cabinet who claimed to share the same left wing values to take him on in another leadership election So Jeremy Corbyn the reluctant leader who had to be persuaded to stand in 2015 now found himself fighting to hold on to a position he never expected to hold this time as favourite rather than as outsider And back on the campaign trail among his own supporters he seemed to rather enjoy himself As was the case a year earlier thousands of people flocked to hear Mr Corbyn speak at rallies across the country 10 000 turned up at a single event in Liverpool as he sought to tap directly into grassroots support for his message as a counterweight to the perceived hostility of the mainstream media In an unconventional campaign which saw him endorsed by UB40 but vilified by JK Rowling the only genuine moment of discomfort came during traingate when his claims that a train was so ram packed that he had to sit on the floor came into question after Virgin Trains released footage showing him passing empty seats Mr Corbyn s re election has strengthened his position with signs some of his critics are willing to serve under him again despite their differences But it remains to be seen whether his commitment to reach out to his opponents and focus squarely on winning the next election will act as springboard to a new phase of his leadership or prove only a temporary respite in what some have said is an existential battle for control of the party", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link The man who was prime minister last Christmas and isn t this Christmas thinks he knows why I stand here as a great optimist about how we can combat populism It may seem odd that I am so optimistic because after all the rise of populism cost me my job So said David Cameron recently on the lecture circuit for the defeated at DePauw University in Indiana in the United States The man who is president of the United States this Christmas and won t be for much longer has opined on the subject too This whole issue of populism Maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary the phrase populism But I am not prepared to concede the notion that some of the rhetoric that has been popping up is populist Barack Obama said recently OK then Mr President let s take you up on that dictionary idea There is no definition of populism It is like liberalism or conservatism It varies from continent to continent and century to century John Judis the author of the book called The Populist Explosion told BBC Radio 4 s The World at One But he added Populism is based on a dichotomy on a differentiation between the people and the elite So can the word populist be usefully attached to Jeremy Corbyn Donald Trump and Brexit The strategy that we adopted was really quite a simple one because we realised that to get attention similar to Trump we had to be outrageous recalled Andy Wigmore the director of communications for Leave EU a group he described as the provisional wing of the broader Leave movement during the EU referendum campaign There was an element of pantomime to our approach The more outrageous we were the more attention we discovered we got The more attention we discovered we got the more outrageous we were That was the foundation of our campaign The Trump campaign in America was their template Their critics describe both as crude irresponsible and yes populist But Andy Wigmore said that was unfair it was about engaging those who had until then given up on politics They were the two and a half million people who had never voted before very much in Labour strongholds And that is what we concentrated on So were we irresponsible to put messages out to them No We had to use every weapon we could against an establishment that was attacking everything that was said and everyone who was saying it Nigel Farage being a classic example So is there a parallel here however unlikely between Mr Farage and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn There is the common theme of being against the establishment and challenging an establishment that has become completely corrupt and out of touch with the people Hilary Wainwright the co Editor of the socialist feminist and green magazine Red Pepper said Nevertheless Jeremy s whole ethics and political demeanour is one of him a politician believing in the people He is actually not simply giving a voice to the people but also attempting to build a politics that shares power with the people I don t think that is yet built into the understanding of populism The success of those who define themselves against the so called establishment arguably creates a bigger challenge for them having won because of the scale of what their supporters expect them to achieve But looking at President Elect Trump John Judis has noticed a partial shift in emphasis What Trump has done is he s definitely shed some of his populist rhetoric The idea that he was going to drain the swamp of all of these fat cats who were controlling Washington He s ended up with an administration filled with Wall Street people and billionaires But in terms of some of his demands about jobs no longer being shipped overseas bad trade deals changing the relationship with China he is going to try to do them When a populist takes power that doesn t necessarily mean they are going to fail at their task Let s conclude by returning to that fuzzy concept of populism Douglas Murray an associate editor at The Spectator magazine says the word is so debased in reality it only conveys one impression When I see the term populism used I know the author is referring to a movement the author he or she doesn t like That is what it does It signals to the listener that the thing they are deprecating is to be deprecated But he argues whether you think the term has any value or not what it is attempting to describe does matter and must be celebrated We had in Britain for years a mounting problem about this issue about our relationship with the European Union I am amazed that so many people have chosen to interpret the most legitimate expression of dislike that you can do ie voting and interpreting that as some awful rabble like unwashed monstrosity It is the only thing we have to stop something far far worse", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn

head of the population in Western Europe Reality Check verdict In 2014 England and Wales did indeed have the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe marginally ahead of Scotland Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg was on Radio 4 s Today programme on Thursday talking about prison reform Together with former home secretaries Jacqui Smith and Ken Clarke he had written a letter to the Times calling for the prison population in England and Wales to be cut from the current level of more than 85 000 to the level in 1993 of about 45 000 They referred to 1993 as being the year in which Michael Howard said that prison works The prison population grew rapidly after that point especially in the following five years In the last five years it has been pretty much static at about 85 000 Since 1993 the prison population has almost doubled over a period when the overall population of England and Wales has grown by about 17 Mr Clegg was only talking about England and Wales because in the rest of the UK the justice system is a devolved power controlled by the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly He also said We already have higher rates of incarceration per head of the population than anywhere else in Western Europe This chart based on Eurostat figures for 2014 shows that England and Wales is indeed ahead of the rest of Western Europe with 146 prisoners per 100 000 population narrowly ahead of Scotland s 145 Northern Ireland had 93 prisoners per 100 000 population Read more from Reality Check", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter

of the single market then the portmanteau for Greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word Brexit he predicted Reflecting on being first to use the term he says I had no idea but got a phonecall a couple of months ago from the Oxford English Dictionary It certainly gives one the moral authority to say what it means Mr Wilding took his inspiration from Grexit the term used for Greece s possible exit from the eurozone In January and February 2012 it was all about the Greek crisis he said It didn t take a great leap of faith to replace the G with a B so that s how it came about It s one of those odd things that crops up in life I had forgotten all about it so when I was told I found it amusing It could have all been slightly different Brexit was far from set in stone and faced

three years before its use really took off Not really according to Professor David Crystal one of the world s foremost experts on language From a linguistic point of view it s just another word he

argued that the scheme helped to push up house prices Under the programme borrowers were able to get a mortgage with just a 5 deposit If those borrowers were unable to make payments the government promised to compensate the lender But around 30 banks or building societies now offer similar high loan to value loans so the Bank of England declared in September that the scheme is no longer necessary The Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme which is only available on new build homes will remain on offer until 2020 in England alone Have you used this scheme If so email us at haveyoursay bbc co uk So far the Mortgage Guarantee scheme has cost the taxpayer a relatively small amount of money Up to 30 September only two home owners had defaulted on their mortgages meaning that the Treasury has had to pay out just 17 411 to compensate mortgage lenders In the long run it has set aside a potential 12bn to pay out in compensation With interest rates at record lows default rates have also been minimal However when interest rates eventually rise more borrowers are likely to default on mortgage payments so the Treasury may have to pay out more The guarantee on such mortgages and thus taxpayers liability lasts for seven years after they are taken out As a result the Treasury won t know the final cost of the scheme until June 2024 Where can I afford to live Have you used the Help to

smoothly in its early weeks previously secret papers show Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the cabinet in April 1989 that the number of people who would refuse to pay would be relatively small north of the border Just 20 months later Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher resigned Sir Malcolm now admits that non payment UK wide contributed to her downfall The cabinet papers also show that defence chiefs approved plans to shoot intruders at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde after activists broke into the control room of a nuclear submarine The security lapse left Mrs Thatcher utterly horrified And they detail a row in government over funding for Gaelic television Chancellor Nigel Lawson opposed extra public funding because he did not want to inflict more on a largely unwilling audience a letter from his department shows But Sir Malcolm lobbied successfully for government cash to increase Gaelic provision The files have been published at the National Archives in London under 30 year rules The poll tax officially called the community charge was introduced in Scotland a year before it was rolled out UK wide It became one of the most controversial policies of Mrs Thatcher s final years as prime minister Millions are thought to have refused to pay across the UK Protests included a riot in London s Trafalgar Square in March 1990 Confidential cabinet papers show Sir Malcolm briefed colleagues including Mrs Thatcher on 20 April 1989 three weeks after its introduction in Scotland The record of the meeting does not include direct quotes but it summarises Sir Malcolm s contribution The implementation of the new arrangements was proceeding smoothly and the issue had almost completely disappeared from the press it says It would not be possible until the summer to form a clear view of how many people would refuse to pay but present signs were that the number would be relatively small though they might include some prominent names Sir Malcolm added that the main source of complaint was the cost for second homeowners who he noted were facing considerably higher charges than they had under the previous system Other papers show Sir Malcolm opposed a cap on the amount which could be charged despite support for the move from Mrs Thatcher and John Major Speaking following the release of the papers Sir Malcolm told BBC Scotland that his initial assessment was entirely accurate based on what we were seeing at that particular stage The reason why it was all going reasonably smoothly is worth remembering he said The whole demand for abolition of the old rating system had really begun in Scotland People found the old rating system very very objectionable and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that all those people who wanted rates abolished were very pleased in the first phase when the community charge was introduced to replace it It was announced in 1991 less than three years after its introduction that the poll tax would itself be replaced Sir Malcolm now says its introduction was a political mistake He said the domestic rates system had been seen as grossly unfair which had created great pressure to reform local government finance I have no hesitation in retrospect in saying that the whole reform was a mistake certainly a political mistake but it wasn t the end of civilised life as we know it Also included in the files is correspondence between Chancellor Nigel Lawson and cabinet colleagues in which he made clear his opposition to extra government money to increase the amount of Gaelic language broadcasting in Scotland He approved a letter in October 1988 highlighting commercial views that Gaelic programming led to a reduction in average viewing figures The letter adds This suggests there is little demand for the 100 hours of Gaelic TV broadcast at present I do not believe we ought to inflict more on a largely unwilling audience He argued the issue should be left to market forces and had the backing of Mrs Thatcher in his general opposition to government grants But Sir Malcolm argued that the level of Gaelic broadcasting at the time was pathetic In an exchange of letters with senior ministers he said the service was unsatisfactory and said improvement was essential Sir Malcolm was eventually successful in getting approval for public funding of Gaelic television though the money came from the Scotland Office s budget rather than the Home Office which at the time had responsibility for broadcasting Sir Malcolm told BBC Scotland I took the view that Gaelic was an indigenous Scottish language It might only be a tiny number of people who spoke it but if it wasn t given the kind of support through broadcasting that was being suggested the whole language could wither away and part of Scotland s heritage would disappear with it The sums that were required were not substantial We could afford them within the Scottish block which I had discretion to deal with but I had to put it through my colleagues At first there was resistance but we overcame that", "29 December 2016 Last updated at 09 42 GMT British Cycling has been unable to provide evidence that a package sent to Sir Bradley

Party s single biggest source of funds The election of Unite s general secretary is something of a proxy battle in the struggle for Labour s soul There is a widespread belief among many of the party s MPs that if there is an early election Jeremy Corbyn will not only lead Labour he will lead it to defeat and then probably step aside There is a hope that if the election takes place as scheduled in 2020 Mr Corbyn will choose to stand aside sooner if polling remains bleak Even his shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has suggested he has a year to turn the poor polls around Under either scenario there would be another leadership contest in the next few years Those on the left would want to see Mr Corbyn replaced by a candidate with similar politics But under Labour s current rules a Corbyn ally might struggle to get the support of enough MPs to enter the race If however the threshold for getting on the ballot were to reduce from 15 of MPs to 5 then a left candidate would almost certainly exceed it and the increasingly left wing grass roots membership would most likely vote for them But in order to change those rules Labour s ruling national executive NEC would have to agree The current Unite general secretary Len McCluskey so far has staunchly defended Jeremy Corbyn and should Mr Corbyn choose to go the union leader would work hard to ensure Labour s rules were altered to make a left wing successor more likely As well as having its own representatives in the trade union section of the NEC next month s merger with the construction union UCATT will boost Unite s influence on Labour s ruling body And although not elected in the trade union section insiders point out that as a Unite member the party s treasurer Diana Holland can also be relied upon to vote with her colleagues on the NEC All in all the union can rely on five votes or one in seven of NEC members That doesn t sound much but the party s ruling body is finely balanced between Corbyn critics and supporters and some recent votes have been decided on very narrow margins Mr McCluskey s main challenger Gerard Coyne is privately backed by some prominent anti Corbyn MPs and peers His pitch is that he would concentrate on defending members jobs and conditions and spend less time on internal Labour politics And if he were elected anti Corbyn MPs believe that he would act as a bulwark against further attempts to move the party to the left Mr Coyne s supporters are confident that he stands a chance of winning Three years ago Len McCluskey triumphed on a turnout of just 15 Mr Coyne s backers believe he can boost participation and he already has a solid base in the West Midlands and in some of the union s biggest branches Tom Watson Labour s deputy leader and a West Midlands MP has been personally if not politically close to Len McCluskey in the past He won t officially endorse a candidate but he gave me a far from ringing endorsement of his old friend s time in office It is a golden rule for Labour politicians never to interfere in union elections but Unite members have a big choice to make British workers have had a terrible decade when it comes to pay and conditions and they will want to know the person leading the biggest union is totally focused on their interests I say to Unite members make sure you use your vote it s a vital election and very often people can win elections like these on a very low turnout The general secretary has a great influence on politics Len McCluskey is a close personal friend of Jeremy Corbyn Members can help change the course of history if they decide to vote Faced with Gerard Coyne s challenge Mr McCluskey has been defending himself on his right flank by recognising that the free movement of labour has exercised a downward pressure on wages though he has also pointed out that reports suggesting he favours restricting migration are a deliberate lie But the entry in to the race of a candidate to the left of Mr McCluskey has unsettled the incumbent s supporters They are sceptical that grass roots member Ian Allinson will get the necessary nominations from 50 of the union s branches to compete in next spring s ballot but if he does it could cost Len McCluskey support Last time round challenger Jerry Hicks also attacked Mr McCluskey from the left and got more than a third of the vote Ian Allinson is portraying Mr McCluskey as an establishment candidate and positioning himself as the true friend of Jeremy Corbyn thus potentially splitting the left vote In the statement declaring his candidacy he said it is essential this election does not become a battle between Len McCluskey offering more of the same and Gerard Coyne offering to turn the clock back to the bad old days when our union backed New Labour Mr McCluskey was dismissive of Mr Allinson when I spoke to him pointing out that his prospective rival isn t a Labour Party member Instead he was more concerned about the motives of those to his right and see the challenge from Gerard Coyne as an attempt to destabilise Jeremy Corbyn There is no doubt the right wing of the Labour Party are going to try to use Unite as a political football and Gerard Coyne is falling in to this trap I have heard him say I spend too much time in the political arena he knows that s not true Ninety five per cent of my time is spent on industrial matters My members won t take kindly to anybody outside the union abusing the democracy of the union by using it as a proxy war But whether it ought to be or not it s almost certain the battle within Unite will reflect

are supposed to be a role model critics say and they have abused their position and let everyone down But not everyone in the public eye generates this reaction when they misbehave Politicians even the famous ones seem to be rarely considered in this way People might react with anger or just roll their eyes but the term role model is rarely used Why not As well as selflessness integrity objectivity accountability and openness MPs are required by their code of conduct to show leadership and to promote such qualities by example This certainly sounds like role model material But the message isn t getting across says 20 year old Chante Joseph a former member of the National Youth Parliament Part of the problem is that MPs are from a completely different world to most young people she says Young people are not really saying I want to be Theresa May when I grow up Miss Joseph points to the lack of votes for 16 year olds as an example of the disconnect In order for you to have a role model you need to see something in that person that reflects you so you think I could be like you MPs are doing good work she believes but they don t communicate in a way that young people understand And they are unlike more conventional celebrities she thinks because they try to present themselves as being flawless Speaker John Bercow has warned of young people being turned off by MPs

to be an easy to understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past A referendum a vote in which everyone or nearly everyone of voting age can take part was held on Thursday 23 June to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union Leave won by 52 to 48 The referendum turnout was 71 8 with more than 30 million people voting Get the results in full England voted for Brexit by 53 4 to 46 6 as did Wales with Leave getting 52 5 of the vote and Remain 47 5 Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU Scotland backed Remain by 62 to 38 while 55 8 in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44 2 Leave See the results in more detail Britain has got a new Prime Minister Theresa May The former home secretary took over from David Cameron who resigned on the day after losing the referendum Like Mr Cameron Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people She has said Brexit means Brexit but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote although the value of the pound remains near a 30 year low but opinion is sharply divided over the long term effects of leaving the EU Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index which includes more British based businesses trading higher than before the referendum The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0 5 to 0 25 a record low and the first cut since 2009 will stave off recession and stimulate investment with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain s economy is doing The European Union often known as the EU is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries click here if you want to see the full list It began after World War Two to foster economic co operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other It has since grown to become a single market allowing goods and people to move around basically as if the member states were one country It has its own currency the euro which is used by 19 of the member countries its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas including on the environment transport consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017 meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019 depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations Once negotiations officially begin we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU on trade and immigration The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep change or retain A court challenge to Theresa May s right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament was successful in the High Court Downing Street has since appealed to the Supreme Court with a judgement expected in January Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks Even if the government s appeal fails it does not mean necessarily that there will be any delays to Brexit It is expected that in those circumstances usual business might be cleared so a very short Act of Parliament could be brought forward to go through the Commons and Lords Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given because most MPs have said they would respect the EU referendum result having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit Read a simple key points guide to the Supreme Court case Theresa May set up a government department headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis to take responsibility for Brexit Former defence secretary Liam Fox who also campaigned to leave the EU was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson who was a leader of the official Leave campaign is foreign secretary These men dubbed the Three Brexiteers will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements although it will be Mrs May as prime minister who will have the final say The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are Once Article 50 has been triggered the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond now Chancellor wanted Britain to remain in the EU and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations The terms of Britain s exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments a process which could take some years he has argued EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws but not take part in any decision making Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will to some extent be making it up as they go along The post Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe some of whom may want to hold referendums In very simplified terms the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market which allows tariff free trade if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK The UK says it wants controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services such as those in the City of London The challenge for the UK s Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU Some Brexiteers such as ex chancellor Lord Lawson say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership the UK should end uncertainty by pushing ahead with Brexit and not waste time trying to negotiate a special deal These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK s departure from the EU There is no strict definition of either but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK s relationship with the EU post Brexit So at one extreme hard Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market At the other end of the scale a soft Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result Ex chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a hard option while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent EU nationals with a right to permanent residence which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years will be be able to stay the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the will of Parliament he added A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU If it remains within the single market it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions then other countries could reciprocate meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work Again it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non EU citizens limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages Citizens Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay He has said there might have to be a cut off point if there was a surge in new arrivals People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote The day to day spending impact is likely to be more significant Even if the pound regains some of its value currency experts expect it to remain at least 10 below where it was on 23 June in the long term This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive some price rises for food clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite s makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores However the current UK inflation rate is 1 so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations As mentioned above the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market if that is what it wants while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country down to a sustainable level which she defines as being below 100 000 a year It is currently running at 330 000 a year of which 184 000 are EU citizens and 188 000 are from outside the EU the figures include a 39 000 outflow of UK citizens It seems highly unlikely Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave The Liberal Democrats who have just a handful of MPs have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election Some commentators including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option Yes Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance to avoid having to give away her priorities but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there While there could be limitations on British nationals ability to live and work in EU countries it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists There are many countries outside the European Economic Area which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland Lichtenstein and Norway that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries Yes It is a British document there is no such thing as an EU passport so your passport will stay the same In theory the government could if it wanted decide to change the colour which is currently standardised for EU countries says the BBC s Europe correspondent Chris Morris The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU s biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together The European Union single market which was completed in 1992 allows the free movement of goods services money and people within the European Union as if it was a single country It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it The idea was to boost trade create jobs and lower prices But it requires common law making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a level playing field Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule Read more A free trade area v EU single market No nation state has ever left the EU But Greenland one of Denmark s overseas territories held a referendum in 1982 after gaining a greater degree of self government and voted by 52 to 48 to leave which it duly did after a period of negotiation The BBC s Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is democratically unacceptable that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain A second independence referendum for the country is now highly likely she has said Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be very profound and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification But speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn F in for a border poll saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist During the referendum campaign David Cameron said the so called triple lock for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings inflation or 2 5 every year whichever is the highest If economic performance deteriorates the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing as an alternative to cutting interest rates which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money Though it s worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty free sales as an upside or silver lining of Brexit As with most Brexit consequences whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out whether the customs union agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty free would be an incredible boost for my business but he later said that remark had been light hearted Erik Juul Mortensen president of the Tax Free World Association TFWA said after the referendum vote it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be They are at the moment but no one knows the longer term prospects for definite The EHIC card which entitles travellers to state provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment in any other country within the EU as well as several non EU countries is not an EU initiative It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area often simply referred to as the single market plus Switzerland which confusingly is not a member of the EEA but has agreed access to the single market Therefore the future of Britons EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA Probably not says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris because there s no EU wide law on vehicle registration or car number places and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons given that a lot of MPs all SNP and Lib Dems nearly all Labour and many Conservatives were in favour of staying The referendum result is not legally binding Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament the House of Lords and or the Commons could vote against ratification according to a House of Commons library report In practice Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020 The European Court of Human Rights ECHR in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution It was set up by the Council of Europe which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions However the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK in favour of a British Bill of Rights As part of that the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over rule judgements handed down by the ECHR However the EU has its own European Court of Justice whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate and enter accession talks with the EU Every member state would have to agree to the UK re joining But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency once they meet the relevant criteria although the UK could try to negotiate an opt out The UK Independence Party which received nearly four million votes 13 of those cast in May s general election has campaigned for many years for Britain s exit from the EU They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party s MPs including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving They said Britain was being held back by the EU which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return They also cited sovereignty and democracy and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and or work One of the main principles of EU membership is free movement which means you don t need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ever closer union between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a United States of Europe Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain s membership had the country voted to stay in He said the deal would give Britain special status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn t like about the EU like high levels of immigration but critics said the deal would make little difference Sixteen members of Mr Cameron s Cabinet including the woman who would replace him as PM Theresa May also backed staying in The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign The Labour Party Scottish National Party Plaid Cymru the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU as did other EU nations such as France and Germany Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and they argued the flow of immigrants most of whom are young and keen to work fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services They also said Britain s status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club rather than going it alone Big business with a few exceptions tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money people and products around the world Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre there s interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU Four of the

because of the fall in the value of the pound Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make 15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency Others are less optimistic Hilary Jones a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was terrified about the economic impact She added that while the firm s Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany Yes says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc and others wanting to join in the future and the common language tends to be English much to France s chagrin she says Probably not is the answer It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules and it s hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products Thanks for sending in your questions Here are a selection of them and our answers The good news for Edward from Cambridge who asked this question is we have been working on exactly such a list Click here for the latest version In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out only France and Germany contribute more In 2014 15 Poland was the largest beneficiary followed by Hungary and Greece The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers which added up to 4 6bn in 2014 15 According to the latest Treasury figures the UK s net contribution for 2014 15 was 8 8bn nearly double what it was in 2009 10 The National Audit

is not possible to say definitively what would happen At the moment the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries If Britain remains in the single market or the European Economic Area as it is known it might be able to continue with this arrangement according to a House of Commons library research note If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states it may opt to continue paying for expats healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad if the country where they live declines to do so Dee from Launceston wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU The answer is that they would remain in place initially at least After the Leave vote the government will probably review all EU derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas which are designated by the EU would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation which relate to bats and their habitats The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection Martin from Poole in Dorset wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels We don t exactly know because the details were never worked out HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20 000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34 000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted Instead payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live David Cameron said as many as 40 of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6 000 a year of in work benefits when his emergency brake was applied The DWP estimated between 128 700 and 155 100 people would be affected But the cuts would have been phased in New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided The plan will never be implemented now Sophie from Peterborough who asks the question need not worry We have consulted Alasdair Rendall president of the UK Eurovision fan club who says All participating countries must be a

outside of Europe Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957 16 years before joining the then EEC As with most elements of the UK economy not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices Industry figures have pointed to uncertainty among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market So far the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members This primarily records sentiment among surveyors It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote However the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia surveyors predict House prices were already slowing in central London owing to the fall out from changes to stamp duty rules in April Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0 9 or 2 647 in July compared with June It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote Many potential first time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns Investors in property or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long term reduction in value Ged from Liverpool suspects red tape is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection According to the Open Europe think tank four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment related The UK renewable energy strategy which the think tank says costs 4 7bn a year tops the list The working time directive 4 2bn a year which limits the working week to 48 hours and the temporary agency workers directive 2 1bn a year giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones are also on the list There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU And the costs of so called red tape will not necessarily disappear overnight if Britain opted to follow the Norway model and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU derived laws would remain in place Ste in Bolton asked about this The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen Cheerleaders for TTIP including former PM David Cameron believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year But many on the left including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations undermine public services wreck food standards and threaten basic rights Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US Paddy from Widnes wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU which it claims is 350m a week could be spent on the NHS instead The BBC s Reality Check team looked into this claim Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as scaremongering and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP see answer above the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger

England exposed huge differences in the level of support for the Remain and Leave campaigns in London and the rest of the country Boston in south Lincolnshire recorded the highest leave vote in the UK with 75 6 backing Brexit The borough of Lambeth in south London saw almost the reverse result with 78 6 of voters supporting Remain The BBC visited the two boroughs at polar opposites of the European Union referendum The vote comes against the backdrop of local concerns over the number of migrant workers in the town and the increased pressure on local services Many are from Eastern Europe attracted by work in the agricultural industry Among those obviously pleased with the result was a street sweeper driving his vehicle past a group of UKIP councillors at 6am and giving a smile which was accompanied by a thumbs up sign It was a sentiment shared by many voters in one of the UK s most extreme examples of a town affected by recent EU immigration The only other people in the town s market square were small groups of people waiting for a lift to work Every one of them hailed from Eastern Europe and this is a common sight in this town Yvetta from Lithuania spoke to reporters as she waited for her bus to work She said What happened happened while her friend Martinez questioned what the government would do with people like him who come from other countries He added I hope it will be all right but we don t know Now we are waiting Other foreign visitors offered a different perspective on the result Fredrick Meon from French TV station ARTE which was filming in Boston said In France reaction is a bit polarised divided but basically happy that the British will leave Economically I think Britain will suffer for the next few years some countries of the EU will see some benefits of this and I think France could be one of them Recent surges in migration to Boston mean that an estimated 14 of people in the area were born in other EU countries and that may be a reason why some of the more than three quarters of people here voted Leave Steve making his way through Boston town centre on his way to work said he was concerned by the outcome of the vote I really don t know if it is the right thing he said I m worried for my job I work for a small business you don t know what effect it is going to have on that But another Steve who like so many others voted to leave said he was tired of the EU telling the UK to jump and David Cameron saying how high The 2011 census showed that the district had the largest number of non British EU passport holders outside of London Figures showed 12 1 of Boston residents held such passports compared with the Lincolnshire average of 3 5 Protests have been held in the town about the level of overseas workers despite the local unemployment rate being below the national average at 4 4 as against 5 2 nationally The town s Conservative MPs Matt Warman who supported Remain said We ve got to respect the fact that if people want to take that gamble then we have to get the best deal for the country ultimately what is in everyone s interest is a stable economy in a time of transition However for those expecting things to happen immediately they might be disappointed this new dawn in true European style is likely to take some time On the streets of Brixton there was sadness disappointment anger and even calls for London to secede from the UK following the vote to leave Europe Finding anyone who backed Brexit in an area where four out of five people supported the Remain campaign was almost impossible Many shoppers stallholders and residents in this ethnically diverse but increasingly gentrified area of south London expressed frustration that despite overwhelmingly voting to stay in the European Union immigration concerns elsewhere in the UK meant they would be removed from the EU Mohammed Baez a manager at Brixton Foodland fears trade tariffs will be introduced and prices will go up I feel very sad we are out because I prefer we stay in together We get many products from Europe and it does effect when things go up because we don t sell as much Mr Baez who has lived in the UK for about 17 years added I believe because this thing happened that recession will start again People will lose their jobs because when the taxes come things will become more expensive and it will affect the business Many people from the North have voted about immigration But the people who separate what is the answer for them I haven t heard any good answers saying This is what we are going to do Helen Palmer of Herne Hill became visibly emotional when she described why she believed Brexit was bad for the future of her family and the country I felt very angry when I looked at the voting demographics and saw that it was older generations who were voting and really choosing a future for the country that the younger generations did not choose Everyone we know in this borough believes passionately in integration and working with others I m standing in Brixton Market feeling quite emotional because it s a hugely vibrant cosmopolitan mixed up melting pot of cultures We feel the same about Europe no matter what are the faults of the European Union we have to be inside and have to co operate and collaborate with our fellow Europeans Vernon Ray first came to Lambeth from Jamaica in 1959 to work for London Transport He says the referendum result is the worst thing that could happen in the history of Britain Now everything is going to be way over the top We re going to have to pay back through the nose It s very upsetting Lambeth became cosmopolitan and that is one of the reasons it voted to remain The issue is immigration and this why they the UK opted out but in three or four months time they will realise the mistake they ve made Midwives Olivia Snowball and Rebecca Manners were concerned about the impact of the vote on London I m really gutted that we ve left said Ms Snowball Having spoken to all of my friends and seeing what my friends on Facebook and Twitter were saying it just seemed to be overwhelmingly that we would stay but obviously that s not what everyone else thought Ms Manners said Absolutely gutted that we voted out I think there s definitely going to be a drop in the housing market throughout London which some people will say is a positive thing But I think that the immediate effects will be quite negative and again especially within the NHS I think we are going to see big changes throughout there as well Italian Camilla Cabasso expects Britain to experience an immediate and a long term change for the worse She was not eligible to vote but when I asked her what she thought of the referendum result she shrugged her shoulders and sighed It s not so positive for people that come from other parts of Europe She believes the UK could become more about control because it would now not work together with other European countries Another Italian who works at a

this link Do people still play Happy Families at Christmas Well I know we all try it is the season of goodwill to all even to relatives but actually I ve been thinking about the card game It was devised by John Jaques a long established British company which manufactures games and which in 1851 commissioned John Tenniel to decide what they would look like Mr Dip the Dyer and Mr Dose the Doctor were among the patriarchs painted by Tenniel who later provided the illustrations for Alice s Adventures in Wonderland Sadly there was no Mr and Mrs and Master and Miss Ballot the politician and his family One explanation may be that party politics does not always cross generations that sons and daughters can end up in a different political family from their parents That thought came to mind after reading what Robert Courts David Cameron s successor as MP for Witney had to say about his family during his maiden speech in the House of Commons He was following not in his father s steps but in those of his great grandfather Albert Stubbs had been MP for Cambridgeshire for the five years following World War Two He only won the seat by 44 votes not surprising when you realise he was a member of the Labour Party in a county which was then solidly Conservative Stubbs a print worker and trade unionist spent much of his time at Westminster fighting for the interests of agricultural workers Admitting his late ancestor would be horrified by his party label Mr Courts told the Commons that he hoped to honour his memory by copying his work ethic He won his seat by getting out on his motorcycle riding around the villages of Cambridgeshire and signing up the workers to the union he said Perhaps he s fortunate that great grandad wasn t around to see young Robert as a Conservative or he might have suffered the fate of Ernest Millington A Westminster contemporary of Stubbs he won a by election just before the end of the war for Commonwealth a radical party of the left As a teenager in the early 1930s Ernest had polished his platform performance at Speakers Corner Years later when I interviewed him for BBC Radio 4 he told me how his father a former soldier and a working class Tory had heard his son speaking and was disgusted by it Political difference wasn t the proximate cause but Millington junior believed it contributed to his father throwing him out of the family home when he was just 16 years old Both men clashed with Churchill in the Commons Millington told me he d elbowed the Conservative leader out of the way in order to speak from the opposition despatch box as a party leader albeit a parliamentary party of just one while Robert Courts recounted how Churchill responded to an intervention from his great grandfather by dismissing him as ignorant Yet Churchill too would have struggled with a game of happy political families Like his father Lord Randolph a youthful chancellor of the exchequer whose brilliant career was cut short by resignation and then an early death Winston was a Conservative but his father would not have approved of his son ratting on the Tories by joining the Liberals in the early years of the 20th Century Indeed he retained a sentimental attachment to the Liberal Party long after he d returned or re ratted as he called it to the Tory fold in 1951 he offered Clement Davies the Liberal leader a cabinet job By then Davies was leading a parliamentary party that was a mere shadow of the one in which Churchill and David Lloyd George had made their names The latter of course never wavered even if his definition of what it meant to be a Liberal appeared to veer both right and left over a long career The same can t be said of his children Megan was a Liberal MP for 22 years lost her seat and when she returned to the Commons a few years later it was for Labour the party she remained in until she died in 1966 In part the explanation was that the Liberal Party of the 1950s was to her way of thinking a relatively conservative one If that s true though how can one explain the career of her brother Gwilym He d first been elected as a Liberal in 1922 After World War Two though and the death of his father he deserted the official Liberals increasingly voted with the Conservatives and eventually styled himself as a Liberal and Conservative MP a parliamentary breed that only died out late in the 1960s Gwilym Lloyd George served in cabinet under Churchill and Anthony Eden He s remembered now as the home secretary who in 1955 refused to commute the death sentence of Ruth Ellis the last woman to be hanged With some of these examples you begin to wonder whether they d be quite so politically promiscuous if the parent had been around to look them in the eye when they switched parties During his maiden speech last month Robert Courts acknowledged the risk of causing a rift when he told MPs he d be very careful what he said about Albert Stubbs because his grandmother Stubbs daughter was following the speech on TV If I put a foot out of line I am going to get a very strongly worded letter he explained There are more recent examples of succeeding generations switching party Mark Fisher was an MP for 27 years until 2010 Looking at his heritage his father Sir Nigel was MP for the quintessentially Tory suburban seat of Surbiton home of Margo Leadbetter in The Good Life his stepmother had been an Ulster Unionist MP and his maternal grandfather was an earl you might assume that he sat for the Conservatives In fact he was a Labour MP in Stoke on Trent briefly one of Tony Blair s ministers and thereafter something of a backbench rebel under New Labour Watch the proceedings of the House of Lords on TV and you may one day spot a face that seems to have stepped out of the pages of 20th Century history Balding and with a neat moustache he s the spitting image of the man who according to Churchill had much to be modest about Clement Attlee The 3rd Earl Attlee does indeed look like his grandfather but their politics differs A crossbencher for a few years he joined the Conservative benches in 1997 making him in that year something of a political novelty He became a junior minister in the government under David Cameron so like his grandfather he served in a coalition administration which included parties other than his own I know this isn t a very festive subject but my favourite example of potentially unhappy political families has to be the Baldwins Stanley Baldwin was prime minister on and off from 1923 to 1937 A Conservative he helped both to give Labour its first taste of power and to persuade Ramsay MacDonald to form a national government in 1931 splitting Labour in the process Churchill savaged him as the man who put country before party failing to re arm Britain in preparation for war thus making it harder for his successor Neville Chamberlain to pursue any policy other than appeasement Sir John Major by contrast sees Baldwin as a political hero a truly One Nation Conservative Whatever your view of him imagine what it felt like to stand at the despatch box as Conservative leader only to see among those waving their order papers on the government benches opposite the face of your son That was Stanley s experience between 1929 and 1931 when Oliver Baldwin was Labour MP for Dudley not far from his own Worcestershire political powerbase In fact this relationship between father and son offers a lesson for all those political families who fear party difference could lead to a lasting rift In Oliver Baldwin A Life Of Dissent the author Christopher Walker quotes from a letter he sent to his father just after the 1929 general election which propelled Oliver into the Commons and Stanley out of Number 10 Wherever I have gone on my political rounds during the past six years I have never heard any of our supporters speak other than in a kindly way of your personal self To you who have generally been victorious the results may disappoint you but take it from one who until the other day has always been on the losing side always in the minority and generally alone that victory or defeat are both flatterers and as such are

was described as a moderate who supported moves towards gradual reform at Stormont to address the demands of nationalist human rights campaigners Mr Chichester Clark was Conservative spokesman on Northern Ireland at the time His Guardian obituary said Given the traditional unionist links with the Conservative Party Chichester Clark was first disappointed and then disillusioned as even the moderate unionist case for gradual reform he advocated was comprehensively rejected But after his death Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt described him as a role model adding He abhorred extremism and was not afraid to say so no matter what the source happened to be and stood firm while under fire from militant nationalists and unionists alike The killing of the 41 year old Labour MP in her Batley and Spen constituency shocked the entire country It was shortly after 13 00 BST on 16 June a week before the EU referendum was due to be held that reports first emerged that the MP had been

reasons for the determination that it was not in their best interests to be relocated to the UK They are seeking a judicial review in the High Court early in the new year A Home Office spokeswoman said It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings Eleven of those refused entry are aged 14 seven are 15 nine are 16 and one is 17 Sixteen are from Eritrea 11 from Afghanistan and one is from Sudan Eight more waiting to have their cases determined are also involved in the legal bid They were dispersed to 15 reception centres around France when The Jungle camp was dismantled at the end of October The legal challenge is over a scheme named after Lord Dubs who secured an amendment to the Immigration Bill for unaccompanied child migrants to be brought to the UK where they do not have family links but are considered to be at risk Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis Solicitors the firm behind the legal challenge said Shortly before the Christmas break hundreds of unaccompanied children formerly resident in the Calais Jungle before it was demolished by the French authorities whose plight had been the focus of cross party Parliamentary attention in the run up the the Dubs amendment requiring the UK to take its fair share were refused entry to the UK summarily and without reasons The children have been waiting months for the government to formulate a policy and now the policy has failed to allow the relocation of many of the most vulnerable children to the UK in respect of whom the minister had promised to be flexible In fact the way in which the criteria were drawn meant that most of the children from the Jungle were refused Labour s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said children were being left in a miserable limbo She added Our priority must be to protect these children many of whom have had to live through the very worst conditions and have lost all hope The government pointed out that 900 child refugees had been transferred to the UK in 2016 It has not said how many of these were brought to the country under the Dubs amendment as opposed to those with relatives already in the UK", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter

supposed to make local council finance fairer and more accountable Instead it triggered civil disobedience and riots and a rebellion in the Conservative Party Cabinet papers for 1989 and 1990 released today at the National Archives in Kew reveal the reaction to the crisis at the heart of government They show how involved the prime minister herself was And they pinpoint the moment it dawned on her that her flagship policy had turned into a political disaster which was hitting not Labour local councils but her natural supporters The size of the files alone there are nine thick manila folders compiled over 18 months are evidence of how far the poll tax dominated government thinking Mark Dunton a specialist in modern records at the National Archives calls it a juggernaut Though simple in principle the tax proved to be immensely complex in practice The files are full of highly technical papers many of them annotated by Mrs Thatcher They also include a warning from April 1989 that she risked a fine if she didn t complete her own registration form on time But the technical challenges of introducing the tax paled beside the political problems it threw up The government had expected opposition to a measure specifically targeted at high spending mainly Labour controlled councils What they hadn t expected was the reaction from their own supporters as the April 1990 date for its introduction in England and Wales drew near In September the previous year her environment secretary Chris Patten noted a good deal of pressure developing and Nigel Lawson who was to resign as chancellor the following month told Mrs Thatcher We are faced with a potentially difficult Parliamentary situation By January Patten was telling her there could be as many as 83 rebel MPs on the Tory benches And she got a powerful sense of the anger among formerly loyal Conservative voters in March when a constituent of the Norfolk MP Ralph Howell wrote to her Mr WE Jones and his wife were in their 70s living on modest pensions and under the poll tax would be paying more than twice what they paid under the old system of rates while better off people in large houses would be paying less He accused the prime minister of being uncaring You have taken advantage of your position to impose your will upon us to the point where you are now virtually a Dictator riding roughshod over anyone who opposes you he wrote on 3 March In the files released today the couple s address has been redacted though a later memo reveals they lived in a house called Dream of Delight in the village of Great Snoring Howell asked for a meeting The prime minister s adviser Mark Lennox Boyd suggested he should be granted an audience The meeting will be a waste of time but I am afraid she will have to do it to keep his frustration at bay Yet the files suggest it may not have been a waste of time for this was the point when Mrs Thatcher finally realised that something must be done She turned not to her environment secretary Chris Patten who had the job of bringing in the new tax but to her recently appointed chancellor John Major On 25 March six days before an enormous demonstration against the poll tax in London which developed into serious rioting the files contain a note for the record of a phone conversation between the two Instead of the tax shining a spotlight on spendthrift local councils she said the government was getting the blame for high charges and the impact was falling on those in middle income groups what she called the conscientious middle Major agreed with the need for what he called a radical review to find a way to cap charges and give local authorities more money but without increasing overall public expenditure Over the next two months the files reveal a succession of crisis meetings as ministers desperately tried to find a way out of their predicament including the perceived unfairness of a system in which Dukes and dustmen both paid the same One idea was to raise more money Should councils be allowed to use cash from the sale of council houses to subsidise the poll tax Or should people on higher incomes pay more That idea was floated by the prime minister herself in an unusual signed personal minute to Major on 9 April And she had another idea putting an extra penny on a gallon of petrol and distributing the proceeds to councils She wrote in the suggestion by hand three times on a memo of 10 April listing options But none of her colleagues seems to have paid any attention and the idea went nowhere Meanwhile there was a growing split Patten and the local government minister Michael Portillo wanted to increase central government grants to local authorities Mrs Thatcher wasn t having it No she wrote firmly in the margin on one occasion Then she and Major without apparently consulting Patten came up with an idea for allowing local councils to levy a higher poll tax than stipulated by central government provided they first put it to a local referendum a poll tax poll Patten was opposed believing the necessary legislation would be massive in its political significance and difficult to get through Parliament One of Mrs Thatcher s private secretaries Barry Potter suggested that Patten was feeling bruised at being ignored By the end of June Potter told the prime minister that Patten and Portillo still arguing for more government funds were now isolated Today Michael Portillo says he and Chris Patten really wanted to find a way effectively to abolish the poll tax We wanted to take the guts out of it take the bits that were hurting out of it but we recognised for her sensitivity that it would still have to be called the poll tax They also believed the problem would take central government money to resolve It s worth remembering that when the poll tax was eventually replaced by the council tax it cost about 6bn in money of the day an enormous amount And I m pretty sure that Chris Patten and I were asking for only a fraction of that says Mr Portillo As to the lessons to be learnt from the debacle he draws a parallel between the decision to introduce the poll tax without thinking it through and David Cameron s decision to hold a referendum on Europe without thinking through the consequences The lesson ought to be think carefully before you do things But the chances of prime ministers learning that are I think slim But nothing worked The practical difficulties and the political pressures were too great and Mrs Thatcher s career was foundering In November Michael Heseltine an outspoken critic of the poll tax triggered a leadership contest from which John Major emerged the winner He appointed Heseltine as environment secretary increased VAT to generate extra cash for councils and announced the abolition of the community charge and its replacement by council tax in March 1991", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link The civil

to an official report The Social Mobility Commission said it uncovered stark differences between how groups progress into work Some minorities have higher jobless rates although poorer white boys are least likely to go to university Alan Milburn chair of the Commission said the British social mobility promise was being broken British families are told that if their children go to school and work hard they will be rewarded with good jobs and opportunities But for many groups this promise is being broken says the commission s report In recent months the low educational attainment of White British boys has gained significant attention However when it comes to the transition from education to employment this group is less likely to be unemployed and to face social immobility than their female counterparts black students and young Asian Muslims The study was carried out by education think tanks LKMco and Education Datalab looking at how students progress through schooling if they go on to sixth form and university and how their achievements translate into jobs White boys from poorer backgrounds perform badly throughout the education system and are the worst performers at primary and secondary school the report said Black children despite starting school with the same level of maths and literacy as other ethnic groups are most likely to fail maths GCSE Black boys face extremely high levels of school exclusion and perform substantially worse than their female peers And the report said that young black people also have the lowest outcomes in science maths and technology A levels and are the least likely ethnic group to achieve a good degree at university It is disadvantaged young people from white British backgrounds who are the least likely to access Higher Education Only one in 10 of the poorest go to university compared to three in 10 for black Caribbean children five in 10 for Bangladeshis and nearly seven in 10 for Chinese students on the lowest incomes But after school it is young women from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds that are particularly affected Despite succeeding throughout education and going to university they are less likely to find top jobs and are paid less than women from other ethnic minorities the report concluded The Commission has called for action from government educators and employers to narrow these gaps It has also published a list of recommendations including avoiding setting in school and targeting specific groups to try and improve the system Mr Milburn said The British social mobility promise is that hard work will be rewarded This research suggests that promise is being broken for too many people in our society Britain is a long way from having a level playing field of opportunity

about how doctors will cope with demand over the busy winter period Helen Stokes Lampard chair of the Royal College of GPs Council said general practice was skating on thin ice warning Something has to give Some people wait weeks to see a doctor with potentially serious results the Staffordshire based GP said NHS England said GPs would be getting extra funding to extend services Dr Stokes Lampard told the Press Association some patients were already waiting two or three weeks to see GPs for non urgent matters such as suspect lumps or bleeding problems But if they wait three to four weeks the non urgent stuff may be becoming urgent she added With lumps or bleeding problems or things that could be signs of serious disease my profound concern is that people will delay seeking help for things that could potentially be life threatening or life changing if they are not tackled swiftly She went on As a service that is already skating on thin ice a service that is stretched incredibly thinly something has to give Well what do you do If you ve got to deal with people who are acutely sick on the day because people need help then chronic disease management will disappear Describing chronic disease management as the most phenomenal success story of the NHS she added that her big fear was that this would be affected because we are too busy fire fighting the urgent stuff It that happened The knock on consequences could take years to manifest but they will be very serious indeed said Dr Stokes Lampard Speaking to the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 she said GPs want to do the best for the patients so it causes enormous stress as well as fatigue in us when we are fire fighting all the time She said the situation was getting worse because the service is stretched even more thinly than ever due to a lack of funding over the last 10 years Dr Stokes Lampard recognised that NHS England had promised to invest more money into GP services but it had yet to reach the front line She said similar pledges had yet to be made in Wales and Northern Ireland while some investment had been promised in Scotland She went on We need the promises in those countries that haven t had them and where we have had the promises we need them fulfilled We need every penny every person promised getting out there and that will shore up the service because if general practice goes under then the hospitals fall down very quickly too because they will be completely inundated with patients and that s a risk to the whole NHS Dr Richard Vautrey deputy chairman of the British Medical Association s General Practitioners Committee said the issues faced by GP surgeries were a year round problem He added It s particularly acute at this time of the year because of the increase in respiratory illnesses and falls and trips and other types of illnesses that are impacted by the cold weather But it is a pressure that is on every surgery almost every day of the week throughout the year and it s something we have to tackle and we have to tackle urgently Labour described the situation as extremely worrying Shadow health minister Julie Cooper said GP surgeries were overwhelmed by ever increasing demand Add to this a chronic shortage of GPs and a crisis in recruitment and the result is a service that is at breaking point she said An NHS England spokesman said Of course over the Christmas and New Year period the top priority has to be medical emergencies but the RCGP are right to remind everyone of what they describe as the most phenomenal success story of the NHS That s why

general election wrong But were they to blame In the aftermath of the 2015 general election opinion poll debacle I spoke to an old friend in the business He said that normally after such a bad experience you have to wait five years until the next general election to discover whether the changes you have put in place really work However the promised EU referendum meant he and his fellow pollsters would be tested much sooner It is important to remember the scale of the 2015 polling failure because it set the scene for the events of 2016 In the face of a seven point Conservative lead among voters on 7 May 2015 18 of campaign polls had suggested a dead heat and a further had 46 suggested Labour leads Of the 36 of polls that registered Conservative leads during the six week election campaign three quarters published leads that were less than half the actual outcome of seven points Within 24 hours of the close of poll the British Polling Council supported by the Market Research Society issued a classic example of English under statement declaring the final opinion polls before the election were clearly not as accurate as we would like and announcing that they were setting up an independent inquiry to look into the possible causes of this apparent bias and to make recommendations for future polling The report was published in March and focused on one main cause of the failure to correctly call the outcome of the election Our conclusion is that the primary cause of the polling miss in 2015 was unrepresentative samples The methods the pollsters used to collect samples of voters systematically over represented Labour supporters and under represented Conservative supporters The statistical adjustment procedures applied to the raw data did not mitigate this basic problem to any notable degree The other putative causes can have made at most only a small contribution to the total error Polling companies did not wait for the publication of the inquiry before making adjustments to their methodologies but the June referendum on UK membership of the EU presented additional challenges At one level the EU Referendum should have been much easier for pollsters Whereas in general elections we require them to achieve high levels of accuracy for each of at least four political parties in a referendum there are only two choices Yes or No Leave or Remain However there was one important missing ingredient in the referendum as far as pollsters were concerned namely how people had voted previously Westminster voting intention polls invariably ask respondents not only how they intend to vote in the next general election but also how they voted in the previous one This past voting data allows them to make important adjustments to their samples with the aim of strengthening their overall accuracy But there was no such past voting data support for the pollsters in 2016 as there had only been one previous referendum and that one held in 1975 Mike Smithson of Political Betting gets pretty fierce with those who claim that polls in the 2016 referendum delivered a similar car crash to the 2015 general election He calculates that of the 34 referendum campaign polls 17 gave leads for Leave 14 had Remain ahead and three suggested a dead heat That is a reasonable point but the traditional test of how they performed is the record of final campaign polls compared with the outcome On this specific measure the polling industry still appears to be languishing in Purgatory In June the British Polling Council reported its analysis of the final EU referendum polls published by seven member companies No company correctly forecast the actual result although in three cases the result was within the poll s margin of error of plus or minus three points In one case Leave was correctly estimated to be ahead In the four remaining cases however support for Remain was clearly overestimated This is obviously a disappointing result for the pollsters and for the BPC especially because every single poll even those within sampling error overstated the Remain vote share In addition there were three on the day polls combining actual voters and others reporting their voting intention on polling day published by BMG YouGov and Ipsos MORI and these predicted Remain leads of 53 52 and 54 respectively We have witnessed polls that consistently overstated Labour support and many that overstated support for Remain All too often in the past polling errors at elections have been forgotten because the polls concerned still predicted the correct outcome The mortal sin is to predict the wrong outcome and the heat is on the polling industry today because that is precisely what it has done in the two biggest political events of 2015 and 2016 But what about polling in the US presidential election Here we need to begin by reflecting on the US electoral system Presidents are elected as a result of winning a majority of electoral college votes not the national popular vote To assess the accuracy of polling in the 2016 presidential election we need to look at national polls for their measure of the popular vote received by the candidates and then polling in individual states to discover how well they predicted the outcome of the crucial electoral college votes The highly respected Cook Political Report observed On average polling in 2016 was closer to the results of the election than it was in 2012 President Obama s final popular vote margin was 3 9 points but the RealClearPolitics running average before election day was 0 7 points a difference of 3 2 points The difference in 2016 was just 1 1 points Specifically the RealClearPolitics running average of 10 final polls sampled between 1 and 7 November 2016 gave Clinton 46 8 and Trump 43 6 compared with the final outcome of Clinton 48 2 and Trump 46 1 a respectable performance with the final average within sampling error and predicting the correct winner of the popular vote The US polling problem lay with the state wide polls If we look at the 13 swing states those that either changed allegiance compared with 2012 or were decided by 5 or less of the popular vote we find that Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were predicted for Clinton when they voted Trump and that in Iowa and Ohio the predicted Trump wins significantly understated his final margins of victory The EU referendum campaign did not restore the badly dented reputation of pollsters in the UK following their grim performance in 2015 And in the US performing well in predicting the popular vote but getting important state polls wrong leaves you with egg on your face and President Trump I do not envy the pollsters as they navigate their way through a society that is increasingly fragmented and where increasing numbers of people are refusing to stay in their box The EU referendum saw the largest turnout in England since the 1992 election 2 8 million more people voted in the 2016 referendum than in the 2015 general election In 2015 the main polling problem was defined as unrepresentative samples At the close of 2016 it still is"]
