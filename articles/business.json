more as acquaintances you have to put up with in the workplace to get the job done Management consultant Phil Dibbs says he found it impossible to get on with one of his co workers when they both worked for Westland Helicopters Caroline was in procurement and I was working in sales selling the helicopters to the Ministry of Defence We should have collaborated but we hated each other absolutely hated each other he says We did not work together very well at all We had to get our assistants to talk to each other to get things done otherwise discussions would go on well after it was time to go home She thought I was arrogant I thought she was aloof and standoffish but gorgeous The two never considered meeting outside work at that point says Phil but later on a friend engineered a drink in a bar in York and they revised their opinions of each other At that point there was no romantic interest but it grew from there says Phil And their socialising outside of work was definitely more fruitful than their initial working relationship We got married in Las Vegas and have now been together for 14 years Phil and Caroline s experience shows that life outside of work can be very different from the nine to five And their experience is not unusual One in five of us 22 have met our partner at work according to a YouGov poll for the TUC while a third of us have had a relationship with a colleague at some point Yet while some of us may thrive in the office social scene others prefer to keep their work and personal lives separate IT consultant Peter Smith says though he gets on well with his co workers he does not meet them outside the office I spend 10 12 hours with the same people why would I want to then go out with them in the evening I need to be able to relax and unwind and I can t really do that with people from the office I don t want to talk about work issues he says I have friends I see at the weekends and evenings and my work colleagues who I might go for a quick lunch with but I try to make sure the two groups don t meet But no matter how much we might try to compartmentalise our lives some workplace events like Christmas parties or leaving drinks can be hard to avoid If you never go to any of them your colleagues may wonder if you re rejecting them and then you might be seen as not one of the team which could be counter productive Indeed talking to your colleagues may help your work rate A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT researchers found that workplace chatter even the idle kind can increase productivity The researchers fitted volunteers with badges containing radio transmitters and microphones to monitor workers interactions and see whether they were work or non work related They found that those who interacted most with their co workers had the highest productivity whether or not they were talking about work or sport Adele Harman a medical PA with the NHS says that having previously worked alone when she joined a team of about 20 she initially resisted socialising But then you realise you need the moral support and this gives you confidence it leads to a more productive office she says Sasanka Sharma founder and chief executive of US engineering and IT firm Iscientia says he makes a point of meeting his team outside work Every now and then we have activities planned for the whole team be it lunch together outdoor adventure or just going out as a team after work hours This builds our relationship helps me know my employees on a personal level and helps them know me as well For him as a company boss there is also a commercial pay off In today s environment it is hard to retain employees and colleagues unless they have an emotional connection to the company he says I would want my employees to be more connected and have a sense of ownership and that can only happen when people work as a team and as one family However it is important to be clear that what happens at work gatherings can never be truly separated from the office so you need to bear this in mind If you re in a bar with your boss no matter how informal things seem you need to remember they are still your boss so don t say anything to them that you wouldn t normally say in the office something that may be harder to remember after a few drinks While getting a reputation for always being in the pub after work may be something to be avoided we are social animals and developing links and friendships with co workers can be useful These links can help you to find out what s really going on in your workplace which may help you in your career When it comes to after hours socialising Phil Dibbs says you don t have to become your co workers best friend but in terms of smoothing your own path at work it does help if you get to know them in the round Something that certainly worked for Phil and Caroline", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Trains on Britain s railways are 21 years old on average an investigation by the Press Association has found It shows the age of British trains is at its oldest in at least 15 years Rolling stock on the Caledonian Sleeper service is the oldest at 41 years old TransPennine Express trains in the north of England and Scotland are the newest at just nine years old Campaigners said train quality was a postcode lottery but the government says it is rolling out new carriages The Office of Rail and Road ORR said older trains can result in less comfortable journeys poorer reliability and worse performance than modern versions although it also noted that older rolling stock can be refurbished Trains in London and south east England are typically 19 years old while regional services are 24 years old The latest ORR figures cover the period between January and March 2016 with records going back to July 2000 Ed Cox director of think tank IPPR North said it was a national disgrace and not what you see in Germany France or Japan It is little wonder that Britain lags behind other developed nations when commuters pay through the nose for decrepit trains he added Mr Cox said areas outside London should be given powers to raise money to invest in transport and take back control over spending decisions The Rail Delivery Group representing train companies said it expects the average age of Britain s trains to drop to 16 years by 2019 due to the introduction of more than 4 500 new carriages Lianna Etkind of the Campaign for Better Transport said the current age of trains exemplifies the lack of public and passenger involvement in the network She added More people than ever rely on the railways they contribute a bigger percentage to running costs than ever they pay more for their tickets than ever and yet there is a postcode lottery in the kind of trains they are served by Last month the National Audit Office warned that delays in electrification of the Great Western rail line could mean passengers in the North and West of England may have to wait longer for newer trains A Department for Transport spokesman said it was delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century rolling out more than 5 000 carriages over the next four years Through rail franchising we also expect the rail industry to come up with more proposals to introduce new carriages and

thyme And it is coming from a new branch of Lloyds Bank It gives that inviting feel that welcoming feel says the building s designer Sarah Harrison You can smell it on the High Street when the wind s blowing in the right direction Lloyds is not the first bank to spot the possibilities of sensory attraction Across the Atlantic one bank offers its customers freshly brewed coffee using the nutty aromas of Arabica to entice new followers In fact rather than banks it calls them cafes In the UK High Street banks are set to close hundreds more branches in 2017 Nevertheless with ideas for alluring new formats the industry believes that the concept of branch banking at long last has the whiff of something positive about it Hence they are investing millions of pounds in makeovers In fact in 2017 at least three British banks will open more branches than they will close When the US firm Capital One launched a digital only bank it thought it would never have to go to the expense of building any branches But seeing that customers wanted a more physical relationship with their bank it changed its mind Now it has 13 banking cafes across the US where a cup of coffee is half price for those who pay with their card Account holders can also enjoy a freshly baked muffin or tuck in to as many bytes of data as they wish from the free wi fi as they do some online or face to face banking We had a digital bank and we needed to connect with the communities that we serve says Shaun Rowley Capital One s director for national expansion These cafes give customers a chance to come in and experience our brand see touch and taste Capital One He describes the branches as more cafe than bank but promises that customers can do any financial transactions they would normally expect There are a lot of banks experimenting with different formats There s all sorts of transformations going on he tells the BBC Among those impressed by the Capital One cafes is Jakob Pfaudler the chief operating officer of Lloyds Bank s retail division There s a bunch of beautiful stores over there where you really have the human touch combined with quite heavy digital content I think that is our mental model he says In 2017 Lloyds is planning to close another 200 UK branches following a similar number in 2016 But it will also build some new large ones Yes there will be some branch closures but what we are doing is reformatting the entire branch network over the next four or five years and building more of the branches like the one in Clapham One other feature of the Clapham blueprint is a giant video wall on which customers can view house prices in nearby streets or get property buying tips The aroma device is now a key part of Mr Pfaudler s thinking too It moves further away from the traditional rather stiff branch environment So while it wasn t necessarily a design feature I think we re going to roll this out into many more of our branches maybe not that specific scent although I like it In 2017 at least three smaller brands expect to grow their network Metro Bank which opens its latest branch in Basingstoke on 31 December is planning a dozen new stores as it calls them Both TSB and Handelsbanken will also expand their branch numbers next year And Santander will upgrade as many as 60 branches At a pilot branch in central London customers can already pay in cheques and cash at the same machine they use to withdraw money And they can receive an email confirming the transaction The old style counter complete with tellers is hidden away at the back Uniformed customer service assistants show members of the public how to switch to the new style cash machines For the customer to understand all the functionality on an ATM to pay in a cheque for the first time for example they ll often need a colleague to walk them through it says Martin Bischoff managing director of retail distribution at Santander If banks get this wrong there could be trouble The story is told by one banking executive of how a Polish online bank opened its first branch only to find an army of customers queuing up outside as they had just been presented with their first opportunity to complain In case customers really lose it another executive told me they now plan so called defusing rooms in their branches where account holders can be taken to cool down It s not just the branches themselves that are changing It s their attitudes to customers In an attempt to be more welcoming some in the industry want their branches to feel like hotels or restaurants From a physical perspective hospitality offers a very good role model says Ray Erscheid senior vice president for store design at Bank of America If you think about a hotel experience it can be relatively scripted you enter there s a welcoming experience you re either directed to where you want to go which might be the restaurant or there s a check in experience He even refers to the front of house staff member as the concierge Again I would go back to the hotel experience The doorman might be able to get you a taxi they might be able to tell you where the nearest restaurant is but they re going to turn you over to the concierge if you say you want a particular kind of dining experience So we want to have that same idea But one expert warns about being too free thinking with branch design Marcus Pequeno a Spanish banking consultant remembers the case of a South American bank wthat decided to offer free coffee wi fi and soft drinks in a refurbished branch The morning of the opening did not go according to plan Basically there were 100 students in front of and inside the branch hanging out and taking selfies he told a conference called Branch Transformation earlier this month They were doing anything but banking So don t expect your branch to turn into a coffee bar in 2017 But don t be surprised if a visit there feels better and quicker than it used to With perhaps a few nice smells to enjoy at the same time", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link What one piece of technology would most improve your working life Chances are it wouldn t be a glove But car workers in Germany are now using smart gloves that not only save time but prevent accidents as well It is an example of how tech enhanced humans are fighting back against the seemingly unstoppable rise of the robots At BMW s spare parts plant in Dingolfing for example which employs around 17 500 people hand held barcode readers have been replaced by gloves that scan objects when you put your thumb and forefinger together The data is sent wirelessly to a central computer The hi tech gloves allow workers to keep hold of items with both hands while scanning more quickly While this may only save a few seconds each time BMW reckons it adds up to 4 000 work minutes or 66 hours a day Formally launched in November ProGlove s plug and play Mark glove is fitted with an integrated scanner and battery with enough charge to last an eight hour shift It costs 1 300 1 095 1 350 Other companies using the glove include rival car makers Audi and Skoda and precision engineering firm Festo The access point is connected to a company s existing system via USB or a normal serial connector meaning the glove can be deployed with no integration expense says ProGlove chief executive Thomas Kirchner In the US sick leave costs employers 226bn 182bn a year while in the UK over the last 12 months firms lost more than 4bn on leave related to minor ailments Lifting related injuries alone cost US businesses more than 70bn last year After flu back pain is the main cause of absenteeism New York based tech company Kinetic is trying to address this issue with a belt mounted device that senses workers posture when lifting and gives them feedback when the position could be improved by bending the knees more for example Managers can see all the collected data on a dedicated web page helping them to spot areas for improvement The Kinetic system also gives advice on how workplaces could be redesigned to reduce potentially dangerous practices The system has recently been piloted at Crane Worldwide Logistics distribution facility in Texas where it helped reduce the number of potentially damaging lifts performed by workers each day by 84 the company says Such wearables are helping humans give robots a run for their money For example aircraft manufacturer Boeing has been piloting a version of Google Glass the search giant s augmented reality eyewear to help technicians wire up its planes These highly complex webs of wires known as harnesses have to be connected up according to a road map that technicians refer to on a laptop or tablet But now they can read the instructions on the head mounted display thanks to a specially developed app called APX Skylight leaving their hands free to carry on snipping the wires to length and connecting them up Boeing says the pilot saw assembly times reduced by 25 and crucially the number of errors fell too And in the mining industry one of the most dangerous in the world technology is helping to keep miners safe and improve production For example Canadian company Maestro Mine Ventilation has developed an award winning digital gas sensor that is more accurate than traditional sensors By constantly monitoring the quality of the air the build up of dangerous gases can be spotted earlier and fresh air pumped to those areas This can also save on electricity as the fans can be operated only when needed rather than all the time It s not just physical injury that can lead to absenteeism stress and illness are prime culprits in the workplace IT giant Oracle claims its absenteeism costs have plunged by 1m as a result of wellbeing interventions such as stress workshops US health insurer Humana believes its Goal Guru health and wellbeing app can increase productivity by improving employees

course the iPhone There are many ways in which the iPhone has defined the modern economy There is the sheer profitability of the thing of course there are only two or three companies in the world that make as much money as Apple does from the iPhone alone There is the fact that it created a new product category the smartphone The iPhone and its imitators represent a product that did not exist 10 years ago but now is an object of desire for most of humanity There s the way the iPhone transformed other markets software music and advertising But those are just the obvious facts about the iPhone And when you delve more deeply the tale is a surprising one We give credit to Steve Jobs and other leading figures in Apple his early partner Steve Wozniak his successor Tim Cook his visionary designer Sir Jony Ive but some of the most important actors in this story have been forgotten 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in It is broadcast on the BBC World Service You can listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast Ask yourself what actually makes an iPhone an iPhone It s partly the cool design the user interface the attention to detail in the way the software works and the hardware feels But underneath the charming surface of the iPhone are some critical elements that made it and all the other smartphones possible The economist Mariana Mazzucato has made a list of 12 key technologies that make smartphones work 1 tiny microprocessors 2 memory chips 3 solid state hard drives 4 liquid crystal displays and 5 lithium based batteries That s the hardware Then there are the networks and the software So 6 Fast Fourier Transform algorithms clever bits of maths that make it possible to swiftly turn analogue signals such as sound visible light and radio waves into digital signals that a computer can handle At 7 and you might have heard of this one the internet A smartphone isn t a smartphone without the internet At 8 HTTP and HTML the languages and protocols that turned the hard to use internet into the easy to access World Wide Web 9 Cellular networks Otherwise your smartphone not only isn t smart it s not even a phone 10 Global Positioning Systems or GPS 11 The touchscreen 12 Siri the voice activated artificial intelligence agent All of these technologies are important components of what makes an iPhone or any smartphone actually work Some of them are not just important but indispensable But when Mariana Mazzucato assembled this list of technologies and reviewed their history she found something striking The foundational figure in the development of the iPhone wasn t Steve Jobs It was Uncle Sam Every single one of these 12 key technologies was supported in significant ways by governments often the American government A few of these cases are famous Many people know for example that the World Wide Web owes its existence to the work of Sir Tim Berners Lee He was a software engineer employed at Cern the particle physics research centre in Geneva that is funded by governments across Europe And the internet itself started as Arpanet an unprecedented network of computers funded by the US Department of Defense in the early 1960s GPS of course was a pure military technology developed during the Cold War and opened up to civilian use only in the 1980s Other examples are less famous though scarcely less important The Fast Fourier Transform is a family of algorithms that have made it possible to move from a world where the telephone the television and the gramophone worked on analogue signals to a world where everything is digitised and can therefore be dealt with by computers such as the iPhone The most common such algorithm was developed from a flash of insight from the great American mathematician John Tukey What was Tukey working on at the time You ve guessed it a military application Specifically he was on President Kennedy s Scientific Advisory committee in 1963 trying to figure out how to detect when the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons Smartphones wouldn t be smartphones without their touchscreens but the inventor of the touchscreen was an engineer named EA Johnson whose initial research was carried out while Johnson was employed by the Royal Radar Establishment a stuffily named agency of the British government The work was further developed at Cern those guys again Eventually multi touch technology was commercialised by researchers at the University of Delaware in the United States Wayne Westerman and John Elias who sold their company to Apple itself Yet even at that late stage in the game governments played their part Wayne Westerman s research fellowship was funded by the US National Science Foundation and the CIA Then there s the girl with the silicon voice Siri Back in the year 2000 seven years before the first iPhone the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency Darpa commissioned the Stanford Research Institute to develop a kind of proto Siri a virtual office assistant that might help military personnel to do their jobs Twenty universities were brought into the project furiously working on all the different technologies necessary to make a voice activated virtual assistant a reality Seven years later the research was commercialised as a start up Siri Incorporated and it was only in 2010 that Apple stepped in to acquire the results for an undisclosed sum As for hard drives lithium ion batteries liquid crystal displays and semiconductors themselves there are similar stories to be told In each case there was scientific brilliance and plenty of private sector entrepreneurship But there were also wads of cash thrown at the problem by government agencies usually US government agencies and for that matter usually some arm of the US military Silicon Valley itself owes a great debt to Fairchild Semiconductor the company that developed the first commercially practical integrated circuits And Fairchild Semiconductor in its early days depended on military procurement Of course the US military didn t make the iPhone Cern did not create Facebook or Google These technologies that so many people rely on today were honed and commercialised by the private sector But it was government funding and government risk taking that made all these things possible That s a thought to hold on to as we ponder the technological challenges ahead in fields such energy and biotechnology Steve Jobs was a genius there s no denying that One of his remarkable side projects was the animation studio Pixar which changed the world of film when it released the digitally animated film Toy Story Even without the touchscreen and the internet and the Fast Fourier Transform Steve Jobs might well have created something wonderful But it would not have been a world shaking technology like the iPhone More likely it would like Woody and Buzz

your footwear Or feeling a tingle in your yoga tights if your Downward Dog position needs improvement And what if you could feel the things you re touching as you roam through a virtual reality VR world This is the science of haptics the intersection between technology and the sense of touch For most of us our experience of haptics has been restricted to a buzz in our pockets when a phone message arrives or force feedback on gaming joysticks and steering wheels But observers believe the technology which has been in development for decades is finally ready to hit the big time thanks to faster processors cheaper sensors and the take up of VR headsets The global market for haptics tech is forecast to reach nearly 20bn 16bn by 2022 according to research firm Research and Markets So what are some of the real world applications of this touchy feely tech Well if you ve bumped into lamp posts and fellow tourists trying to follow map directions on your phone smart shoes and insoles could be the answer Embedded with haptic sensors that are connected via Bluetooth to your phone s navigation app the shoes vibrate telling you whether to turn left right or carry straight on Through touch a lot of information is being processed by the brain but the brain isn t trying to compute what it means says Krispian Lawrence chief executive of makers Ducere Technologies It s just an instinctive reaction While the footwear was originally intended to help visually impaired people Ducere is also appealing to athletes or anyone who wants route guidance without having to stare at their phones all the time And vibrations can be applied to other parts of the body too no tittering at the back Australian company Wearable Experiments is using haptics to help yoga devotees know when they need to correct their shape The firm s Nadi X yoga tights have several sensors embedded in them at the hips knees and ankles We use pose detection software that determines what is correct and incorrect says Wearable Experiments designer and director Billie Whitehouse This is communicated back to the person wearing the pants with directional feedback indicating which way to rotate the hip knee or ankle to do the correct alignment By increasing the frequency and intensity of the vibrations the tights tell you how far off you are from the ideal positions as illustrated in an accompanying app The firm hopes to apply the technology to a range of interactive clothing and has already launched a vibrating shirt for fans that enables spectators to feel as well as see the action And people with back problems could be alerted when their posture needs improving for example Of course we can feel things without necessarily touching them and it is the art of simulating the sense of touch that is proving so important in the VR world Haptic sensations are generated by skin displacement and forces on the human body and a particular combination of skin displacement and applied force is associated with each sensation says Eric Vezzoli founder of GoTouchVR com a haptic technology company This requires another machine to generate the sensation Some companies are experimenting with targeted ultrasound as a way of simulating the feeling of pressing buttons or turning dials even though your hand is waving about in thin air And this ultrasound technique is also being applied to tablet screens varying their slipperiness at different points to mimic the feeling of pressing 3D buttons This feeling can also be achieved using highly targeted vibrations or electrical impulses The motor industry in particular is interested in these techniques so that drivers can operate flat screen displays without taking their eyes off the road Combine these ultrasound techniques with high definition cameras and VR glasses and it should be possible to transmit a sense of touch across the world enabling people to shake hands or hug despite being thousands of miles apart A more direct approach is to don exoskeletal gloves that manipulate the hand to mimic the sensation of touching or holding objects in a virtual setting UK based company Generic Robots has developed SimuTouch a training platform for surgeons and dentists that employs haptics enabled machines and VR to simulate real world procedures While viewing haptically enabled virtual images of teeth a dental student holds a realistic dental tool like a drill that is connected to a haptic machine As the student moves the drill around the haptic device pushes back and recreates the forces that would be experienced if real life drilling were taking place Force feedback haptic devices are small robots mounted on the desk or worn on the hand like an exoskeleton that recreate the experience of shape stiffness and weight They create realistic interactions in VR for training explains Dr Alastair Barrow director of Generic Robotics Although the company has been working on haptics for 10 years it is the cheap and easy access to the visual side of VR that has proved to be a catalyst for the company says Imogen Clare the firm s head of communications Other companies working on similar technology include France based HRV Haptic Virtual Reality While the haptics market is forecast to grow strongly the tech itself is still in its infancy argues Mr Vezzoli Our comprehension of the haptic system is nowhere comparable with our knowledge of the vision and hearing systems where the in depth knowledge of human perception and more than 100 years of technical development gave us Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and VR headsets says Mr Vezzoli Ultimately the success of haptics will depend upon designers and developers understanding how the sense of touch works scientifically but also how it

One of the first professional clowns in Hong Kong the 35 year old says that for the past 15 years he has been pursuing what he calls a positive career that makes people happy Often fully booked Ken Ken can earn as much as HK 550 000 71 000 57 000 per year And such is the continuing popularity of hiring a clown in Hong Kong for kids parties that he is far from alone While he cut a lone figure back in 2001 Ken Ken says that today there are as many as 50 other professional clowns in the special administrative region and that the number is rising fast In fact such is the current demand for clowns in Hong Kong that employment agencies are organising classes to train up people One such agency is Grace Training and Development Centre Enya Hui one of its employment officers says that clowning is now a viable career path The current popularity of clowns in Hong Kong is in marked contrast to the woes faced by the entertainers in the US and Europe who this year have had to endure the so called creepy clown craze This unlikely phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic saw people dressing up as scary clowns to terrify children and adults alike It led to some schools going as far as even banning children from talking about the craze Against such a backdrop it is not surprising that clowns in the US and Europe have recently found bookings harder to come by mums and dads are not likely to hire a clown for their child s birthday party if their little one is now scared of them What is less well known is that the clowning industry has been in long term decline in its established markets with the World Clown Association saying that membership numbers have fallen by almost a third over the past 10 years from about 3 500 to 2 500 So why are clowns struggling in the US and Europe but booming in Hong Kong and other Asian countries such as India When not performing as a clown Ken Ken s real name is Kenneth Ng Describing his clown persona as a happy and hyperactive five year old Mr Ng says that it took him 10 years to develop the character While he always plays the same role he says that every performance is different With up to 100 performances a year plus income from training other clowns at a weekly class Mr Ng earns enough money from being a clown for it to be his only profession This is in marked contrast to most clowns in the US and Europe who usually need another job to supplement their income Julie Varholdt 52 a fourth generation clown from Phoenix Arizona says that a typical clown in the US earns just 14 000 11 400 a year This is five times less than Mr Ng so one reason for the growing popularity of clowning in Hong Kong but decline in the US is inevitably financial Ms Varholdt says she is able to make enough money from being a clown called Lovely Buttons not to require a second source of income but that it s not an easy ride It takes a lot of work to be a full time entertainer you have to market yourself constantly and work to secure your gigs she says In the Indian city of Mumbai Martin Flubber D Souza is another full time clown He says he feels empowered when he becomes his character Despite his family s objections the 47 year old became a professional clown after completing two university degrees one in physics and another in management He now earns a good living both performing himself and running a clown hire business that has 80 other performers all university students on its books Mr D Souza says more young Indians want to become clowns because the youth of today are looking for an alternative form of education and employment He adds They are bored with conventional nine to five jobs and clowning has become respectable Mr D Souza also thanks the popularity of Indian films In India many youngsters are taking up dancing and performing thanks to Bollywood I really believe there s a hunger for the stage and recognition because everyone wants to stand out Today parents aren t shy to say that their son or daughter is a clown Another difference between clowning in Asia and that in the US and Europe is a significant age gap You don t find a lot of young clowns in the West says Mr D Souza The average age of clowns in Asia is between 25 and 30 whereas in the West the average age is over 50 In the West they don t think of clowning as a lucrative career but in Asia people are really looking at it as an alternative to an office or factory job As discussed the problem for most clowns in the West is that it doesn t pay a great deal At least outside of working for the likes of circus groups Ringling Bros and Cirque de Soleil and Disney To attract more clowns in the US and Europe there will need to be an increase in popularity which would raise demand and therefore earnings This may be sometime away However Kenny Ahern co owner of Wisconsin based Clown Camp the world s largest clown school says he is not worried Clowning has not lasted throughout time without reason and I don t expect it to be going anywhere he says", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Ever since she was a child Ilham Benami had wanted to make kaftans I

cuts which some families may still frown upon Ilham designs kaftans that mix European and Western influences They are part of the booming Moroccan textile sector which accounts for 30 of the country s industrial employment and 15 of its exports Now that kaftans are moving from the domestic into the international market their success is pulling women into the workforce It is a good way to earn a respectable income given the fact that a third of women in the country are unemployed For women s independence these days it s a lot easier compared with when I was growing up says Ilham I wanted to work and fashion has always been a passion of mine so I was going to still follow my passion no matter what my circumstances were In Marrakech Morocco s tourist capital 32 year old Wafaa Redwani and her younger sister Sana have been running their own kaftan business for seven years with their Vallasco Gallery brand It is an haute couture boutique Sana is the fashion designer and Wafaa manages the business The kaftans here range in price from 200 to about 2 000 The business has been so successful they have opened up in Taroudant in the south of the country The kaftans have been modelled in Africa Fashion Week in New York and are exported to Portugal Wafaa says the designs have a more Western cut with a Moroccan touch which explains why they are becoming more successful internationally The success of women like Ilham Wafaa and Sana demonstrates that Moroccan women are becoming more financially independent The president of the Democratic League for Women s Rights Fouzia Assouli is optimistic about women s opportunities in business but says there is still a lot to be done I think that there is a big emphasis on women entrepreneurship these days in the country says Fouzia I believe it s thanks to Miriem Bensalah Chaqroun who is president of the CGEM business lobby group and is one of the most influential businesswomen in Morocco and in Africa Fouzia believes that since Chaqroun was appointed it has opened doors for Moroccan women in the business sector But she says there is more of an awareness of women s rights among the elite than among the poor who are are still lagging behind However she says the illiteracy rate of women in the countryside has fallen from 90 a few years ago thanks to associations which help poor women to read and write and help them work Many of these vulnerable women are now collaborating with businesswomen like Ilham Wafaa and Sana to help make kaftans work which can sometimes take months to complete For Wafaa the kaftan industry is a symbol of the Moroccan woman of today Our kaftans are like us We are caught between the East and the West just like the designs but we still have our Moroccan identity and we will still fight to

Copy this link We don t want to accept that we re doing badly at anything says Argentina s education minister Esteban Bullrich Whether it is admitting to levels of poverty the inflation rate or weaknesses in the education system Mr Bullrich says Argentina has been ill served by a political culture which has not wanted to face up to uncomfortable truths Improving the quality of schools is the task facing the minister and he says the first point is to admit to the extent of the difficulties This is an education system where most schools are only open for four hours a day and he says that despite previous claims to the contrary only about half of young people actually successfully complete their secondary education The results of the latest international Pisa results published by the OECD this month seem emblematic of the challenge Argentina was not included in the results after confusion over the sample of schools taking the tests so it remains uncertain where the country stands in such international rankings The problems with the test pre dated Mr Bullrich s time as education minister but he is now picking up the pieces Another awkward question is why Latin American countries have been left standing by the rising Asian star performers such as Singapore South Korea and Vietnam who are building their economies on investment in education More stories from the BBC s Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch You can join the debate at the BBC s Family Education News Facebook page Mr Bullrich says that in the 1970s Argentina had a GDP per capita that was five times greater than South Korea now it is three times smaller Argentina has failed to keep up and economies such as South Korea and Singapore are reaping the rewards Even though South Korea started from a long way behind the world is watching Samsung televisions rather than any technology built in Argentina The challenge for Mr Bullrich is how to begin to catch up and he dismisses the self serving argument that Pisa tests are really for European and Asian systems and not applicable elsewhere He says education has to be taken seriously on an international as well as a national stage So when Argentina hosts the G20 summit in 2018 he says an education section will be introduced for the first time Mr Bullrich has an ambitious set of reforms but speaking in London he says it will mean long term investment rather than relying on magic answers from messianic leaders It will take until 2030 to turn around his country s school system says Mr Bullrich which will mean any political benefits will come long after his time in office He wants to extend the school day to six hours and for teachers to have an eight hour day including time for lesson preparation That will mean extra cost but he says the challenge in Argentina is not about funding but how efficiently the money is targeted At present he says Argentina spends about the same proportion of GDP on schools as Finland and adds But we re not spending it wisely Mr Bullrich wants to take ideas from the most successful education systems He wants to learn from the exemplary teacher training approach in Finland and is copying some of the recruitment incentives used in Singapore to get the best graduates into teaching Ideas for improving vocational training and skills are being borrowed from Australia he says There are plans for building 400 to 500 new schools equipped with up to date technology But it is a complicated system to change Mr Bullrich is the national education minister but he has to seek a consensus with 24 regional education ministers When Mr Bullrich was an education minister for Buenos Aires he took a direct approach to trying to tackle chronic industrial relations problems complicated by having to negotiate with 17 different teachers unions He gave teachers his personal mobile phone number and invited them to call him with any problems It was a symbolic statement of wanting to listen and for politicians to show some humility And what really surprised teachers was that he called them back to get details of the real life problems with leaking buildings and unpaid salaries As Argentina s education minister he has tried to protect the status of teachers with a proposal that anyone physically or verbally attacking a teacher should face a higher tariff in fines or jail sentences Mr Bullrich is passionate about reforming state schools There were Pisa test results for Buenos Aires entered separately from the rest of the country which showed significant improvements And in particular he says he was pleased to see the closing of the achievement gap between rich and poor The school system already delivers particularly for those from affluent families and he says that for those pupils standards are as high as anywhere We are preparing children at the level of Finland we have to understand why it s not that way for everyone he

of those loses to close 17 lower Toshiba stocks had already lost 20 on Wednesday and 12 on Tuesday Most people still recognise the name Toshiba for its electrical products but it is a very diverse conglomerate And these latest problems stem from its nuclear services business which brings in about a third of its revenue Toshiba said on Wednesday that it faced a possible heavy one off loss linked to a deal done by its US subsidiary Westinghouse Electric Westinghouse bought a nuclear construction and services business from Chicago Bridge Iron in 2015 But assets that took on are likely to be worth less than initially thought and there is also a dispute about payments that are due It has this week also reported inefficiencies in the labour force at CB I along with other factors driving up costs The size of the writedown is not likely to be established until February but is expected to run to several billion dollars Shares have fallen for a reason investors selling up because of the unease they feel about the position the company is in That uncertainty saw ratings agencies including Moody s and S P cut their ratings on Toshiba s credit making it more expensive for the firm to borrow money A lower share price also reduces the amount of new funds that can be raised by selling shares So if it needs to raise funds that means going to the banks for support or selling off parts of the business Toshiba recently sold its medical business which had been doing well to rival Canon And clearly for investors who ve held on to Toshiba shares they are now worth markedly less than they were just a few days ago Longer term though Toshiba shares had been doing very well in 2016 Until 26 December it was the second biggest gainer on the Nikkei 225 index for the year adding more than 70 Recent days though mean those annual gains have been pared to about 5 Even if it is a one off loss rather than ongoing it seems somebody somewhere got the numbers wrong or did not anticipate the scale of problems at CB I And that reflects badly on the firm s management Toshiba is still struggling to recover after it emerged in 2015 that profits had been overstated for seven years prompting the chief executive to resign Toshiba president Satoshi Tsunakawa has this week apologised for causing concern Toshiba s nuclear business has not made a profit since 2013 And while the firm has said the writedowns announced this week were a one off nuclear services globally are struggling Since the Fukushima disaster in 2011 nuclear energy has been a much harder sell Some governments have opted to scale back how much they planned to rely on nuclear as an electricity source or as in the case of Taiwan turn away from nuclear energy altogether to focus on renewables Big nuclear

Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Thousands of charities in the UK may have to rethink the way they raise money from the public because of new EU regulations The rules will limit the way charities can contact people for donations and that could affect how much money they can raise The EU s new data protection regulations that come into force in May 2018 say charities along with other organisations must have the express consent of members of the public before contacting them This could mean that charities will have to ask everyone on their databases who has donated in the past whether they want to receive future requests for funds It could also mean an end to widely used methods like cold calling and mass mailings There are charities who are worried about how restrictive the rules might be says Daniel Fluskey head of policy and research at the Institute of Fundraising a body which advises charities on how to raise revenue We have charities saying If this gets too restrictive we will lose contact with people We won t be able to ask for money and our services will lose money The first charity in Britain to take action to comply with the new rules is the Royal National Lifeboat Institute or RNLI Based in Poole in Dorset it runs lifeboats and volunteer crews around Britain s coastline and has an annual income of about 190m This year it contacted 900 000 people on its database asking if they still want the RNLI to send them requests for donations About 400 000 said yes so from 1 January it will approach only these people to raise funds Historically the way charities have raised income is to go to the general public to write to them to ask for income says Tim Willett the RNLI s head of fundraising In the future we will only be able to do that with people who have actively opted in to the RNLI s communications strategy That reduces the number of people quite dramatically who we have the ability to speak to We think that s opened up a gap in our income streams over the next five years of 36 5m For the RNLI this means a loss of income of 5 a year Smaller charities with a smaller number of past donors could be hit much harder But the rules could also mean the donor and not the charity must make the first approach The rules are slightly grey in that area says Daniel Fluskey The main thing is that whenever you are giving charities data you have to be informed how it will be used If you haven t been given a choice on how your information will be used and given them your options then you shouldn t be called The Information Commissioner is due to issue guidance in the new year on how the new rules should be interpreted The EU s regulations come in the wake of a series of media reports that some UK charity fundraisers had been buying up people s personal data gleaned from the internet by specialist data mining companies and that they had focused particularly on elderly people who seemed to have large amounts of savings Some people have been pestered with requests from dozens or even hundreds of charities Parliament passed a new law in 2016 making charities more responsible for the methods used by their fundraising agents and several are looking for new ways of raising money The RNLI has been trialling a contactless charity box so that people who may not have any cash on them can tap their debit cards on it to make a donation Blue Cross a charity for abandoned animals has been raising contactless payments using a pet Labrador called Smudge who has a contactless card reader in a coat on

think charities know the direction things are going in says the Institute of Fundraising s Daniel Fluskey There has been a culture shift in fundraising People are not just doing things because they ve worked in the past but making sure they are ethical and working to the values of their organisation The new EU regulations combined with a shift to using new technologies could mean that in the future

November a huge 30 000 job cuts programme less attention was paid to the 9 000 jobs it vowed to create under its Future Pact strategy to develop electric and self driving cars VW was engulfed in the

future transport services But people now see it becoming reality he says The millennial generation no longer regards car ownership as a necessity while the ageing generation sees taxi hailing and driverless technology as the way to keep them mobile Briggs says For years carmakers and tech firms with their different cultures and pace of development eyed each other with mutual suspicion Now they

Central Bank and the single currency Mr Tietmeyer ran Germany s central bank from 1993 until his retirement in 1999 He was a staunch proponent of keeping prices and currencies stable as well as safeguarding the independence of central banks from political interference Hans Tietmeyer was an outstanding president whose actions always followed clear and consistent lines aimed at maintaining monetary stability Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann said in a statement Mr Tietmeyer s tough stance on the economy made him a target of the leftwing extremist Red Army Faction which claimed responsibility for an assassination attempt on him in 1988 He survived the attack after the assailant s gun jammed Born on August 18 1931 Mr Tietmeyer was one of eleven children and grew up in the small town of Metelen A devout Catholic he once considered entering the priesthood before going on to earn a doctorate in economics and social science Mr Tietmeyer began his career as a junior official in the German economics ministry and rose through the ranks to become deputy finance minister under former chancellor Helmut Kohl He joined the Bundesbank executive board in 1990 and ran it during a critical period following German reunification Mr Tietmeyer notably opposed the German government in 1997 over its plans to revalue the country s gold reserves to plug a budget shortfall The way he ran the Bundesbank and his approach to budgetary discipline influenced the model for the ECB which sets limits for government deficits Germany and Europe have much to thank Hans Tietmeyer for

estimated 40 of cash dispensers are empty meaning people are unable to withdraw new notes to replace the old ones they have handed in There has been widespread disruption since prime minister Narendra Modi said in November that 500 and 1 000 rupee notes would no longer be legal The move as meant to curb corruption It has divided opinion especially over how the ban was implemented Early last month the government scrapped the 500 and 1000 rupee notes to crack down on undeclared money and fake cash Deadlines for spending the notes or swapping them for new currency have already passed Some people including those of Indian origin living abroad will be able to exchange the notes in branches of India s central bank until 31 March 2017 but the process will be more complicated than going to a

there have been chaotic scenes in India ever since with people having to spend hours queuing outside banks and cash machines which have been running out of money ATM queues and cash withdrawal limits mean getting currency can still be tricky and there have been several changes of the rules around how much money people can access or deposit The government hopes the measures will encourage more people to have bank accounts and move towards a society less reliant on cash But there are concerns that many poorer people and those in rural areas have yet to get bank accounts Local firms which allow people to make digital payments both online and in shops have reported a surge in transactions as people look for cashless alternatives The government says the move has been a success with the

men earning less than women Reality check verdict Women who work between 10 and 30 hours a week receive a higher hourly rate than men But in all other categories of part time and full time work men earn more than women and if part time and full time work is taken together men on average earn 18 more per hour than women MP Philip Davies has argued that tackling issues of discrimination against men is also important and therefore the Commons Women and Equalities Select Committee should drop the word women from its title In an interview on BBC Two s Daily Politics programme about his new role on the committee Mr Davies pointed out that women working part time earned more per hour than men who work the same number of hours Is this true Women who work between 10 to 30 hours a week do indeed earn more on average than men working the same number of hours according to provisional 2016 figures from the Office for National Statistics ONS In the category of workers who work 10 to 30 hours per week on average men earned between around 25p 3 and almost 1 11 5 an hour less than women The highest gap is between women and men working from 20 to 25 hours per week where the average woman will make 9 66 an hour and the average man 8 67 But this does not tell the whole story If you look at full time and part time workers together you can see that there is a gender pay gap of around 18 across the whole workforce in favour of men If you look at full time work only men earn 9 4 more than women And men working fewer than 10 hours a week also earn more than their female counterparts Part time work in general pays less well per hour than full time roles and a far greater proportion of women than men work part time 41 compared with 12 of men often because they take on the majority of unpaid care for children and elderly relatives So although it is true that men in part time work of 10 to 30 hours per week earn less than women working the same number of hours the reality is that women on average still get paid less than men per hour of work done", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link Massive political events have made 2016 a standout year what impact have these had on the pound shares and the price of oil Sterling s move this year has been dominated by the impact of the referendum Against the dollar it is down more than 15 Yes there have been other factors at play There always are many strands to what happens to financial market process But the currency fell very sharply in the early hours of 24 June as it became clear which way the vote had gone Why a weaker currency It s partly about the Bank of England and its policies The Bank s governor Mark Carney had signalled strongly that he expected leaving the EU to lead to weaker economic growth The markets took that as meaning that there would be cuts in interest rates and perhaps a resumption of the Bank s quantitative easing programme buying financial assets with newly created money The Bank duly met the market s expectation in August Lower interest rates mean lower returns for investors in the currency where rates are reduced so its value tends to fall QE has the same effect partly because it also tends to drive down interest rates across the economy The decline against the dollar also reflects expectations about the US Central Bank moving in the opposite direction All year financial markets have been wondering when will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates again after last year s move the first since 2008 at the depths of the financial crisis The Fed did eventually take action in December The EU referendum has also created uncertainty about the outlook for the British economy though the most pessimistic expectations about the immediate aftermath of a no vote have been proved wrong The uncertainty may also have contributed to the decline in the value of sterling It has certainly helped the London stock market that the British economy has continued to grow reasonably well this year But the fall in sterling was also an important factor supporting shares It does make it easier for exporters to compete internationally For some the biggest companies on the market there is another advantage Many of them miners and oil producers for example earn a lot of revenue in foreign currency especially dollars The fall in sterling means that is worth more when converted into pounds boosting both the profits and share price of the companies concerned So we had a strong gain 14 in the FTSE 100 share index The less international 250 index gained a more modest 3 The price of crude oil is now about double the low it reached in January The market has been driven to a large extent by the rather laborious return to the stage of OPEC group that includes most of the leading oil exporters Often in the past a fall in the price of oil led to an OPEC attempt to reverse the development by agreeing to cut production though it s another question how effectively the member countries would implement any such deal The fall that began in mid 2014 met no immediate response Saudi Arabia OPEC s biggest player was thought to welcome the pressure that falling prices put on shale oil producers in the United States The Saudis also wanted a bigger contribution from other OPEC countries notably Iran Eventually though the response came In September the group agreed in principle to act and then in November a new production ceiling was agreed with some non OPEC members agreeing to take part The result oil prices are still around half the June 2014 level but a lot healthier for oil exporters than there were a few months ago The precious metal is ending the year with a price rise of about 9 But it was a lot higher mid year more than a third higher than at the start of 2016 Earlier in the year things in the US looked rather different Expectations of an interest rate rise receded and some even wondered if the Fed might join the European and Japanese move towards negative rates The prospect that investors might have had to pay to keep money on deposit made gold look more attractive As the US economy gathered some strength later in the year that concern receded and the gold price turned down Far from going down US rates were eventually increased Traditionally gold has been seen as an investment offering protection against inflation Since Donald Trump won the US Presidential election markets have thought there might be more inflation coming as he seeks to boost the economy with tax cuts and perhaps spending on infrastructure The gold price has moved up moderately in the last couple of weeks though if it was a response to the election it was a delayed one In any event inflation in many developed economies is gradually picking up a little from very low levels So perhaps that suggests there is more room for gold to gain too if some investors think they want an anti inflation hedge", "Share this

votes Donald Trump defied almost all predictions to become President of the United States A few months earlier the UK had turned its back on the club of European nations it joined 43 years ago The UK referendum result was a shattering blow to European Union leaders who were only just beginning to breathe more easily after years of battles to keep the euro currency together The decision came as a shock to many but it didn t surprise one economic commentator Roger Bootle chairman of Capital Economics and best known for his accurate predictions in his book The Death of Inflation published 20 years ago Mr Bootle says his reaction to the referendum result has been one of sheer delight He says research shows the main motivation for voters ticking the Leave box was encapsulated in the simple phrase take back control and believes the decision will help the UK economy By contrast a former adviser to the European Commission Graham Bishop says he was appalled and horrified by the result but says he wasn t surprised When you spoke to people you realised the depth of their disillusion with many things of which the EU is just one The voters disillusion was clearly connected with the fact that living standards for the bulk of the British population have continued to decline in recent years and Leave supporters linked that with the recent wave of immigration from the EU into the UK High unemployment in the south of Europe as well as the lack of opportunities in poorer EU countries like Romania and Bulgaria has led to a constant flow of workers into the UK EU leaders had refused to allow the UK to limit that migration arguing that free movement of workers across the bloc was sacrosanct The tide of new workers may well have boosted the total size of the UK economy but in the past 15 years its population had risen by 10 to 65 million Many felt that the new arrivals from poorer countries had forced down wages and property was becoming unaffordable And given that UK health and education are paid for by taxpayers those services were left stretched and demanding more from taxpayers Roger Bootle argues that immigration has indeed depressed wages in the UK and says freedom from European regulations that span everything from loft insulation to working hours will boost the economy The EU is a regulation junkie and I think it s extremely damaging Once we re out we re going to have a national debate and discussion about precisely what rules and regulations we want We ve got to comply with single market rules in order to sell our goods into the single European market that s fair enough That s not the same thing as having the whole load of everything to do with health and safety working hours whatever for a dry cleaning business in Oswestry set in Brussels That is madness And across the whole of Europe not just Britain people are fed up with it Graham Mather is a British former Conservative MEP and now president of the European Policy Forum In view of his contacts in Brussels I asked him if he thought leaders of the EU now regret taking such a tough line saying the UK could never put quotas on immigration from other EU countries I think they made an offer which was going as far as they could because they are all democracies the Romanians the Poles they answer to their people in elections Mr Mather says And if they gave us a deal which allows their people to be discriminated against and pushed out and sent home and so forth their electors would take revenge on their leaders So this is the problem that we are not just a single entity It s a game of 28 separate democracies Donald Trump s election as President of the United States was even more unexpected than the UK referendum result Before the vote Mr Trump had made a series of dramatic pledges They included building a wall along the southern border with Mexico a repeal of President Obama s healthcare reforms and tariffs of 45 on Chinese imports Many voters concluded that free trade had been bad for their prosperity and welcomed Mr Trump s promise of radical change The US stock market has already risen strongly sniffing more government infrastructure spending and lower taxes But the financial reform campaigner Alexis Goldstein says Mr Trump conned voters and his rhetoric pledging to break with the political elite was complete and total garbage He is stacking his transition team

rate according to research from the Halifax Britain s biggest mortgage lender said annual house price growth would be running at between 1 and 4 by the end of the year That compared with an average of 10 in March 2016 Halifax attributed the forecast to a higher than normal degree of uncertainty about the economy in 2017 linked to the recent fall in sterling It said a weaker economy combined with falling affordability would lead to fewer house sales The buy to let sector is also expected to cool further as new tax rules restrict landlords profits Halifax said prices in London would slow more sharply than elsewhere as affordability in the capital was already stretched However the current low cost of mortgages and the ongoing shortage of properties for sale would continue to support prices across the country it said Martin Ellis Halifax s housing economist said The housing market is critically dependent on how the wider economy evolves We consider it most likely that the UK economy will soften over the course of 2017 This is most likely to result from the weakening of sterling pushing up import costs and dragging on purchasing power both for consumers and as a determinant of business investment spending With a higher risk of unemployment rising inflation and affordability constraints housing demand was likely to be curbed Mr Ellis said These factors particularly in London and the South East are likely to result in a further easing in annual house price growth during the coming year continuing the trend seen since the spring of 2016 The forecast chimes with several other

companies was 1 9m in 2014 a rise of 82 in 11 years the study by Lancaster University Management School found However performance as measured by return on capital invested was less than 1 during that period The report s authors said the findings suggested a material disconnect The study commissioned by the investment association CFA UK said the increase in executive remuneration was largely driven by performance based pay It also said the metrics typically used to gauge company performance such as total shareholder return and earnings per share growth were too short termist The research suggested the need for a more refined discussion about the type of performance measures employed rather than remuneration levels and performance related pay arrangements alone Will Goodhart head of CFA UK said Too few of today s popular approaches genuinely align senior executives pay with the economic value that they create Chief executives of companies in the health care sector were the best paid on an average of 2 9m with those in the basic materials and oil and gas sectors on 2 2m and telecommunications at 2 1m Bosses in the lowest paid sectors included technology on 1 3m and

consideration are pay ratios which would show the gap in earnings between the chief executive and an average employee Shareholders would also be handed more powers to vote against bosses pay although

and interviewees they want in it Here Helena Morrissey non executive chair of Newton Investment Management and a campaigner for greater gender diversity in the boardroom gives her take on a subject close to her heart At some point during almost every interview I have ever given the question has come up about how or whether I achieve work life balance To be honest I don t mind being asked ever hopeful that my experiences as a mother of nine children with a pretty intensive City career might encourage other women to go for both though I always mention that it s not compulsory to have nine Career and motherhood should not surely be incompatible in the 21st Century It s a big part of my own story that my husband Richard a former financial journalist volunteered to go freelance when we had our fourth child so he could spend more time at home and have a freer existence which was important to him As we had more children the opportunity the time for him to take on paid work shrank Richard became a full time stay at home dad Along the way he became an ordained Buddhist priest and meditation teacher Between us we have balance All this happened quite some time ago Our fourth child Millie is now 17 and over that time I have been able to build my career secure in the belief that our children were benefiting from the situation Richard is still one of very few fathers at the school gates or watching the girls netball matches and certainly the only dad who s a class rep He says he enjoys his life and suggests that a natural extension of all the efforts to improve opportunities for women in the workplace should be to help men have more choices too But society and the media treats mothers and fathers quite differently on the subject of combining family and career As part of my guest edit of the Today programme we asked men as well as women how they managed to do it all They were all high powered whether in business politics or the arts The men looked surprised by the question and conceded they d never been asked that in an interview before although they all had children in one case four all aged under 11 Their answers were wide ranging My favourite response was from Michael Lewis the best selling author who conceded that travel was the big demand away from home for him but on this particular trip he had dealt with that by bringing my wife and youngest child with me John McFarlane chairman of Barclays has three daughters and spent a large proportion of his career in Australia and Hong Kong while they were growing up John gave flawless advice that life comes first that it s important to know what s important to you and to fit work into that Matt Brittin president of Europe the Middle East and Africa for Google and father of two sons said balance was possible because he loved his job The one answer that no one gave was my wife who stays at home is the key to it all That would presumably seem old fashioned as though they were not playing their part yet in effect it s the answer I give with the roles reversed When I cite Richard as the cornerstone of the Morrissey household everyone seems delighted He is praised as he should be as a thoroughly modern man I should add that it s not just the children that Richard supports he is generous and spot on with his advice to me after long hard days in the office Of course our roles are not as sharply delineated albeit the opposite way around as the traditional husband and wife set up we are partners in every sense So while Richard does all the cooking food shopping and the many school runs I do a lot with the children too I am the chief laundry lady story reader times table tester cake maker present buyer holiday and party organiser And Richard is widely read and highly knowledgeable and opinionated about current affairs and much of our family dinner conversation echoes this A classic comment from one of the smaller children this summer as we sat down to supper I just don t want to hear those two letters E and U And this arrangement works really well even though it evolved without either Richard or I thinking it all through we just knew we were struggling with two careers and a growing family I am guessing that for many of the men we interviewed for the programme their wives have a less intensive career than they do and take the lead parent role but the whole business of working and bringing up a family is shared Those men probably wanted to say it s all made possible by my wonderful wife but felt they couldn t This surely isn t real progress Our aspiration has to be a society where we re all just treated as people where we can focus together on how to lead great lives bring up families develop interests and careers Where men and women can take a different path to traditional roles or not and where they can praise and thank their partners without fear of criticism or challenge Where we live and work and love as partners for the benefit of our families society

have the right to say no to such a union These were just a few of the questions being asked at the second Love and Sex with Robots conference hastily rearranged at Goldsmiths University in London after the government in Malaysia the original location banned it It has proved controversial not only to countries with conservative views There were no representatives from the sex industry in attendance and no sex robots on display leading some to question the point of the event RealDolls a Californian based firm that makes lifelike sex toys claimed that it would release an artificial intelligence enhanced sex doll next year The launch if it happens will be vindication for Dr David Levy who has long predicted the era of intelligent human looking robots He delivered the conference s closing speech in which he made the case for android human intimacy We have companion robots and a partner robot is the logical continuation of the trend he said In the next 10 years it is perfectly achievable in software to create a robot companion that is everything that people might want in a spouse patient kind loving trusting respectful and uncomplaining he said However some enjoy the friction of a relationship and may want to marry an aggressive robot some people would find that exciting The idea of a programmable spouse raises ethical questions particularly as Dr Levy acknowledges that the law would have to recognise a robot as a person It might sound far fetched but over the course of 2016 a number of high level panels were set up with representatives from the tech industry academia and governments to grapple with just such questions As to the rights of any future robot Dr Levy has a simplistic view If a robot s behaviour suggests that it wishes to marry we have to assume that it does There is little evidence in the technology industry that current AI is being embodied in anything remotely human Companion bots such as Pepper and Nao have human characteristics but look more like friendly toys rather than recognisable humans Attempts to make lifelike companions such as Prof Hiroshi Ishiguro s Geminoid which is built in his image are often labelled creepy But there does seem to be a desire to humanise our bots and AIs such as Amazon s Alexa and smartphone assistants like Siri tend to become anthropomorphised by their owners But you only have to look to the world of robotic football to see that we are a long way off a robot that can move like a human Elsewhere the conference was a strange mix of academic papers and heated debate among the audience There were a few studies presented in the splendidly titled field of teledildonics haptic sex toys This included Teletongue an Arduino based device developed by students at the school of media design at Keio University in Minato Japan The idea is to allow long distance lovers to have physical intimacy One partner kisses or caresses an edible lollipop shaped like a body part the researchers are currently using an ear The sound and vibration is then transmitted to their lover who would feel and hear the actions Prof Lynne Hall from the University of Sunderland made the case for more sophisticated sex toys perhaps linked to virtual reality as an alternative to robots A robotic paint sprayer doesn t look like a painter so do we need a sex robot to look like Jude Law she asked She also suggested that sex could be enhanced by strapping on an exoskeleton packed with data collecting sensors I d be happy to give away my data if it made sex better for other people she explained Not everyone might be so willing A few months back Standard Innovation which makes intimate products was sued over claims it had secretly collected data gathered by its smartphone connected devices It settled out of court for an undisclosed sum The Imagineering Institute which is heavily involved in the conference organisation conducted a very small survey on attitudes to robot sex asking only 30 members of its own labs whether they would be interested in intimate relations with a bot The summarised answer appeared to be that while many thought it was inevitable few would want it for themselves It led one member of the audience to sum up the conference We can t agree what a robot is we can t agree what sex is We are almost sure that no sex robots currently exist What we are developing is very crude and almost no one wants it But Goldsmiths senior lecturer Kate Devlin said the event had presented a chance to consider how the industry might develop and the ethical issues it would raise If we have a conscious machine how will we know it s conscious how advanced will that consciousness be what will be our responsibilities towards our creations she pondered Will they have rights Should we build in the idea of consent", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link House price growth was relatively stable in 2016 but is likely to slow next year the Nationwide has said According to its latest House Price Index average prices have grown by 4 5 over the last 12 months the same rate as in 2015 However it believes the UK will see modestly slower increases next year as the economy weakens The building society said house price growth of around 2 was more likely than a decline According to the index all regions saw house price growth in 2016 with East Anglia topping the table for the first time since 2010 with average prices up 10 1 year on year However the above average performance of London s

Northern Ireland remained subdued Nationwide said although each nation saw small gains overall at 2 4 2 2 and 0 7 respectively Robert Gardner Nationwide s chief economist said prospects for UK house prices in 2017 would depend crucially on developments in the wider economy around which there is a greater degree of uncertainty than usual Like most forecasters including the Bank of England we expect the UK economy to slow modestly next year which is likely to result in less robust labour market conditions and modestly slower house price growth he said But we continue to think a small gain is more likely than a decline since low interest rates are expected to help underpin demand while a shortage of homes on the market will continue to provide support for house prices Rob Weaver director of investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner said The proverbial kitchen sink has been thrown at the housing market during 2016 namely Brexit uncertainty and multiple tax changes but prices are still creeping up Admittedly there s been an easing off in the rate of property price growth but what seems clear is that the market has remained resilient and is stable particularly when compared to other investments The combination of record low borrowing rates propping up demand and a severe shortage of both housing stock and available homes for sale has meant prices have continued to rise London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said The real test for the market will come in the early new year when we see whether continuing low mortgage rates and lack of new and existing housing supply prove more relevant than uncertainty over unemployment inflation and the wider economy post Brexit The Nationwide forecast reflects other predictions that point to slower house
